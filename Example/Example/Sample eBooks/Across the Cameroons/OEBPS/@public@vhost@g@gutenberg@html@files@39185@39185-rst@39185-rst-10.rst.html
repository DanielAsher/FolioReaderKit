<p class="pfirst"><span>Harry was not slow to obey.  He fell flat upon his face, whilst a
second bullet whistled over his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come," said Cortes; "we must escape."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As he uttered these words, he turned upon his heel and ran down the
hill, followed by the two boys.  The man held himself in a crouching
position until he was well over the crest-line.  Then he stopped and
waited for his companions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Who is it?" asked Braid, already out of breath as much from excitement
as from running.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The Germans.  They are on our track."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are sure of that?" asked Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Master," said Cortes, "it is not possible to mistake a German bullet.
In this part of the world only those natives carry rifles who are paid
by Kaiser Wilhelm."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Indeed, for weeks already, they had been in the heart of the enemy's
country.  The elder guide was some miles away, and, since they could
not cross the valley, they would have to make a detour; which meant
that they could not possibly rejoin Fernando before nightfall.  By
then, for all they knew, they might find him lying in his own blood,
their provisions and their reserve ammunition stolen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Harry looked at Cortes, who seemed to be thinking, standing at his full
height, his fingers playing with his chin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We must not desert your brother," said the boy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am thinking," said the guide, "it will be easier for him to reach us
than for you and your friend to go to him.  My brother and I are
hunters; we can pass through the bush in silence; we can travel amid
the rocks like snakes.  I could cross that valley crawling on my face,
and the eye of an eagle would not see me.  As for you, you are
Englishmen; you have not lived your lives in the mountains and the
bush; you do not understand these things."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He said this with some scorn in his voice.  There was something about
the man--despite his European clothes--that was fully in keeping with
the aspect of their surroundings, which were savage, relentless, and
cruel.  He went on in a calm voice, speaking very slowly:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In this valley we are safe," said he.  "I know the country well.
Yonder," and he pointed to the north, "there is a forest that lies upon
the hill-side like a mantle.  I will guide you.  It will take us about
two hours to get there.  Then I will leave you.  You will be quite
safe; for many of the trunks of the trees are hollow, and should the
Germans come, you can hide.  I will go alone to my brother and bring
him back with me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They set forward without delay, sometimes climbing, sometimes walking,
on the mountain-side.  About four o'clock in the afternoon they sighted
the forest of which the man had spoken.  It opened out into a mangrove
swamp, thousands of feet below them, where the heat hung like a fog.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Among the trees they found themselves in a kind of twilight.  By then
the sun was setting; but as the daylight dwindled a great moon arose.
Cortes led them to a place, on the verge of a deep ravine, where there
was an old tree with a hollow trunk that looked as if it had been
struck by lightning.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You and your friend will remain here," said the man to Harry.  "I will
be as quick as I can, but in any case I cannot be back until midnight.
If I do not return by then, you will know that I am dead; then--if you
are wise--you will go back to Calabar.  If the Germans come, you will
hide."  And he pointed to the hollow tree.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Without another word he set forward on his way, gliding down the face
of the living rock like some gigantic lizard.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two boys found themselves in a place romantic but terrible.  On
every side they were surrounded by the impenetrable hills.  The trees
of the forest stood forth in the semi-darkness like great, ghostly
giants.  Somewhere near at hand a mountain stream roared and thundered
over the rocks.  The breeze brought to their nostrils the smell of the
swamp lower down the valley.  The hollow tree stood on the edge of the
bush.  A few yards away was the ravine, the bottom of which was wide
and bare and stony.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Throughout the earlier part of the night they possessed their souls in
patience.  It was stiflingly hot after the cool mountain air.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Harry looked at his watch.  It was midnight.  There was no sign of the
brothers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Suddenly they heard a stone shifted from its place somewhere in the
forest to go rolling down into the ravine.  Both stood motionless and
expectant.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I heard something," said Braid.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"So did I," said Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Again a stone was moved, this time nearer than before.  Something was
approaching through the bush.  If this were an enemy they would have
small chance of escaping, for the side of the ravine was inaccessible;
it was like a precipice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They waited in suspense, and presently to the great gnarled roots of
the very tree by which they were standing, there crawled a dying,
wounded mountain goat.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It died almost as it reached them.  Indeed, it was almost a miracle
that the animal had lived as long as it had, for Harry's bullet had
penetrated its chest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The long night passed in waiting, and still there was no sign of the
half-caste brothers.  It was then that they fully realized for the
first time the extreme danger of their mission, that they were alone in
the heart of a country which was almost unexplored, cut off from their
friends and civilization, with no chance of succour and little of
returning in safety to the coast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Jim," said Harry, and his voice was husky, "I wonder if we shall ever
get out of this alive."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I can't say, sir," answered Braid; "but I'm sure of this: if we have
to die, we'll make a fight of it, at least."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was then that a sound came to their ears that caused them to hold
their breath.  It was a loud word of command in the German language,
and which, moreover, came from not far away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They lay down flat upon their faces.  Screened by a clump of long
grass, they were able to look down into the ravine, where they beheld a
company of German native troops with whom were two or three European
officers and several German noncommissioned officers.  The men marched
well in step, keeping their dressing and acting promptly and smartly at
each word of command.  Except for their black skins and coarse negro
features they might have learned their drill on the parade-grounds of
Potsdam and Berlin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two boys regarded them in consternation, mingled with
amazement--due to the fact that in the centre of the company was a
European whose hands were bound behind his back and around whose neck
was a kind of halter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jim Braid recognized this man at once.  It was Peter Klein, the spy.</span></p>
