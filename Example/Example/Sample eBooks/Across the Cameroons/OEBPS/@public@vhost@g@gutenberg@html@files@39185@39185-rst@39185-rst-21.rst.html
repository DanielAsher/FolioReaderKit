<p class="pfirst"><span>The Germans soon found that it was impracticable to attempt to capture
the fort by a direct frontal attack in daylight.  The slope of the hill
was so steep that it was possible to ascend only by way of a path which
was covered by the rifles of the defenders.  Apparently they had no
artillery at their disposal.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At first they charged up this path after the manner in which they were
wont to hurl themselves upon the lines of trenches in Poland and in
Flanders.  They were swept down like chaff.  Owing to the narrowness of
the way they were obliged to advance upon the fort in single file, and
as each man appeared before the loopholes he paid the price of his
daring.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the first assault they resorted to tactics more likely to
succeed.  They attacked twice by night.  But, fortunately for the
defence, the nights were fine and starry, a full moon was up, and it
was possible to see the enemy long before he reached the walls of the
fort.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For all that, the greatest vigilance was necessary both by day and
night, to avoid being taken by surprise.  One or other of the defenders
was always on guard.  Even Peter Klein was of some use.  Though he
could not be relied upon to act with courage or promptitude, his
eyesight was good enough, and he took his turn at sentry by day.
Moreover, he was in such abject terror of falling into the hands of his
own people that Harry suspected that the German authorities at Dualla
had learnt something of the Sunstone and von Hardenberg's private
mission to the Cameroons.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>By night, when the fort might be rushed, they thought it best not to
leave their destiny in the hands of one who had failed them so
constantly.  The only occasion on which Klein had covered himself with
credit was at a moment when fear had so possessed him that he lost all
sense of danger and became for the time being a raving madman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It would be wearisome to describe the details of the siege as it
continued day by day.  There is no question that the defenders would
have held their own for many weeks had it not been that gradually a
calamity was drawing down upon them.  They were running short of
ammunition.  Their bandoliers were nearly empty.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Germans kept up a constant fire upon the fort, and the garrison, in
self-defence, was obliged to answer back.  They calculated that, with
the greatest economy, they had cartridges sufficient to last them only
four days more.  It was then that Klein, Harry, and the guide entered
the hut and held consultation together.  Jim Braid was on sentry,
stationed on the parapet.  The sun was setting in the west.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was Fernando who was the first to speak.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The situation is very plain," said he.  "We can hold out until our
ammunition is exhausted, and then retire by way of the tunnel, still
hoping to reach the caves in advance of von Hardenberg, or we may
retire to-night.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Which do you advise?" asked Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I suggest," said the guide, "that we go at once.  We shall need
ammunition on our return journey to the coast.  We have many miles to
traverse.  Every moment we delay means a further expenditure of
ammunition.  We have not a cartridge to spare."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then," said Harry, "it is settled: we leave the fort this evening."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was then that there came a loud and sudden burst of firing from down
the valley, from the direction of the forest.  All three sprang to
their feet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Braid, from the parapet, called loudly, and they hastened to his side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Look there!" he cried.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Turning their eyes in the direction indicated, they beheld a man
running as if for life towards the forest.  In pursuit, some distance
in his rear, came a large party of Germans, shouting so loudly that
their voices were audible even at that great distance, and firing their
rifles as they ran.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Who is it?" cried Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I cannot say," said the guide.  "He is too far away."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The firing continued until long after nightfall.  It rolled through the
forest like a wave.  It was not until ten o'clock that the night was
still.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The four defenders gathered at the door of the hut.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You think it wiser to go?" said Harry</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Fernando bowed his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, then!  Let each man load himself with such provisions as he can
carry.  We should start at once.  It is necessary for us to be far away
before morning."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Harry Urquhart turned and was about to enter the hut, when he was
brought to an abrupt standstill.  He stood motionless and gaping,
unable at first to believe the evidence of his own eyes.  For there, in
the doorway, within the enclosure of the fort, stood the figure of a
man--a man who was dressed in robes of flowing white.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The Black Dog!" let out the guide, and brought his rifle to his
shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Peace," said the sheikh, lifting a hand.  "Think before you fire."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Fernando's rifle was directed straight at the man's heart.  The Arab
never flinched.  He stood like a statue, speaking in the slow,
deliberate tones of one who is in full possession of his senses.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If you fire," said he, "you slay one who has come to place his
services at your disposal.  You are surrounded by a legion of foes.
Every rifle counts.  I bring you aid."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Slowly Fernando lowered his rifle; then he laughed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We do not want your aid," said he.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There," answered Bayram, "you are wrong."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How so?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Here you are imprisoned.  You must fight to the end.  There can be no
question of surrender."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We do not think of surrender," said the other.  "We mean to escape by
the way you came.  We mean to escape to-night."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Black Dog shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That will not be so easy," he made answer.  "The Germans are receiving
reinforcements; another column is advancing from the south.  The bush
swarms with their reconnoitring-parties and patrols.  Moreover, guns
are approaching up the valley, and may be here at any moment.  I speak
the truth.  Remember, at some risk I have come here of my own accord."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He spoke slowly, as if choosing his words with care; but his English
accent was singularly good.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have not yet told us," said Harry Urquhart, "why you have come."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are short of ammunition," answered the sheikh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How do you know that?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"For five days I have listened to every shot."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have not yet explained," said Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Black Dog smiled, his white teeth showing in the midst of the
blackness of his beard.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I come with a proposal," said he, "under a flag of truce."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have nothing to fear," cut in Fernando.  "You speak of a truce.
We are men of honour."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Very well, then," said the sheikh, "my proposal--or rather the
proposal of him who sent me--is that your party and mine agree to come
to terms.  You have run out of ammunition; we can supply you.  Boxes of
ammunition can be conveyed without difficulty through the tunnel.
Moreover, in order to cover your retreat, I swear by Allah that I will
lead the Germans on a false scent across the mountains to the east."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And in exchange for these services?" asked Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Black Dog paused, looking hard at Fernando.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In exchange for these services," he repeated, "you are to desist from
the pursuit, to allow my employer and myself to pass unmolested in
Maziriland."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this base suggestion, a feeling of such powerful indignation arose
in Harry Urquhart that for some moments he could not find his voice.
When he spoke at last, his voice trembled with passion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You can go back to Captain von Hardenberg," said he, "and you can tell
him from me that he has often enough proved himself a rascal, but that
I never thought that he would sink to such perfidy as to offer us
ammunition to be used against his own countrymen in exchange for his
own safety.  As for you, it is only because you came here of your own
free will that you are allowed to go away in safety.  You took us
evidently both for cowards and fools.  You know now, perhaps, that we
are neither one nor the other.  But there is a limit to our patience,
and I advise you to leave by the way you came as quickly as you can."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Black Dog drew himself up to his full height, folded his arms, and
fixed upon Harry Urquhart his cruel bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"These are high words," said he, "to one who has been the master of a
thousand slaves.  You have asked for war to the knife, and you shall
have it.  It is apparent from the way in which you speak that you know
little or nothing of the man with whom you have to deal.  You shall
see.  I shall prove to you that I am not one who uses empty words."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At that he turned sharply on his heel, entered the hut, and was gone.</span></p>
