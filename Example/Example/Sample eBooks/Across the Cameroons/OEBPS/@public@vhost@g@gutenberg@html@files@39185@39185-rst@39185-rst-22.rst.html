<p class="pfirst"><span>During the next four days the siege continued, and though their enemies
continued to increase in numbers, the Germans were fortunately still
without artillery, which would have battered the old fort to dust and
ashes in the space of half an hour.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On each occasion when the Germans ventured to assault they were driven
back with considerable loss.  Indeed, their dead lay so thick upon the
path upon the hill-side that those who followed after mounted on the
bodies of those who had gone before.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On one occasion a company of native troops actually gained the parapet
of the fort.  It was a dark night, and they had crept up the hill-side
unobserved.  With a savage yell, and as one man, they hurled themselves
upon the ramparts.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The majority were thrown back in disorder under a brisk fire from the
defence, but some half-dozen leapt the ditch and clambered over the
wall.  Thereupon a brief hand-to-hand encounter ensued.  It was an
affair of seconds, of fierce cries and groans and savage oaths, and in
the end the enclosure of the fort was free of the enemy--except for six
motionless forms that lay silent on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Days passed, and still the defence held out.  Indeed, they had actually
put off their retreat until too late, for one night they were brought
face to face with the unexpected fact that the Germans had discovered
the entrance to the tunnel.  Fernando, who had passed almost to the
mouth of the tunnel, which lay in the midst of the bush, returned to
the fort with the news that a large party of German regular soldiers
was guarding their only line of retreat.  Fernando had little doubt
that the Black Dog had found some means by which to betray them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Germans apparently hesitated to advance through the tunnel itself,
since they were still in ignorance of the strength of the little
garrison; and in any case the narrowness and exceeding darkness of the
passage would make an advance an extremely costly affair, whereas
ultimate success was by no means assured.  They could no longer be
blind to the fact that those in the fort were running short of
ammunition, and they could afford to play a waiting game.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The situation of Harry Urquhart and his companions was not of the
pleasantest; indeed, they could no longer hope.  Even Fernando, who had
so often proved himself a man of iron, could see no chance of their
deliverance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As a great storm drives up upon the wind, so this tragedy drew to a
close.  Every round of ammunition--fired in self-defence--every
mouthful of food that was eaten, brought it a step nearer the end.
They were surrounded on every hand.  Great numbers of the enemy had
come from the south; both German and native troops were in the district
in battalions, with transport and ammunition columns and machine-guns.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>By then it was manifest that the Germans could capture the fort
whenever they wished, provided they made the necessary sacrifice in
lives--a thing which, as a rule, it is not their custom to hesitate to
do.  They had not yet, however, deployed their whole strength against
the garrison--a fact that Harry was not able to explain.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The blow, which they had anticipated for days, fell upon a certain
morning, soon after daybreak, when the Germans, their whole force in
the valley, advanced in close formation upon the fort.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the same time a battery of artillery opened fire from the
neighbouring hills, and the immediate vicinity of the fort became a
pandemonium of dust and smoke and flying stones and masonry, whereas
the defenders were well-nigh deafened by the bursting of high-explosive
shells.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In spite of this hurricane of lead and steel, time and again shots
sounded from the fort; but the great wave came on, overwhelming and
irresistible.  One behind the other the ranks mounted the path.  The
defenders kept up a withering fire, until the barrels of their rifles
were so hot they could not touch them.  And still the enemy advanced.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As the Germans gathered themselves together for a final charge, Harry,
Jim Braid, and the half-caste rushed together from the parapet to the
only box of ammunition that remained.  The box lay open near the door
of the hut.  Fernando was the first to reach it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He pulled up sharply, standing motionless and erect.  Then he knelt
down and took out from the box the only cartridge that was there.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is all that is left," said he.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No more?" cried Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We have come to the end," said the guide.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jim Braid turned and addressed his companions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Has no one any ammunition?" he asked, and in his voice was a note of
dire distress.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Both shook their heads.  Peter Klein was cowering in the hut.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is all that remains," said Fernando.  "It shall be put to
excellent use."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So saying he slipped it into the chamber of his rifle and closed the
breech with a snap.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Both Jim and Harry turned away their faces.  In a few minutes they knew
that they must be prisoners in the enemy's camp.  Harry allowed his
eyes to travel over the parapet of the fort.  He saw the German
officers reorganizing their scattered ranks in preparation for a final
charge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And then, from a hill-top towards the south, there came a sound that
was like the bursting of a thunder-cloud.  Something shrieked and
hooted in the air, and a great shell from a heavy gun burst in a flash
of flame in the midst of the German troops.</span></p>
