<p class="pfirst"><span>Leaving the body of the wretched man where they found it, they
continued to search among the trees; but nowhere could they discover
any trace of the elder guide.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"His body cannot be far away," said Harry.  "They fell together."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was then that, at the sound of a faint cry from somewhere far above
them, all three looked up.  And the sight they beheld was appalling.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Hundreds of feet above the place where they stood, sheltered by a
cranny in the face of the cliff, there grew a gnarled and twisted
shrub, a kind of withered tree.  In the midst of this, caught like a
fish in a net, was a man who, even as they watched him, moved, twisting
like a thing in pain.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Cortes scanned the face of the cliff; but, look where he might, he
could discover no way by which it was possible to ascend to the place
where his brother was suspended in mid-air.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Running back several yards, he regarded the precipice above the
withered tree.  It was equally inaccessible from above.  Then he raised
his hands to his mouth and cried out in a loud voice, calling upon his
brother by name.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The answer came in a voice so weak that Cortes had to hold a hand to an
ear in order to catch the words.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am in pain.  My arm is broken.  Can you not come to my assistance?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The younger brother looked about him in despair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Can nothing be done?" asked Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Let me think," said Cortes, and lifted a hand to his eyes.  On a
sudden he cried out to his brother.  "Can you hold out for two days?"
he asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"For two days!" came the answer.  "It is too long."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You must!" cried the other.  "Take the belt from your waist and bind
yourself to the tree.  Then, when your strength is gone, you will not
fall."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Whilst the elder man obeyed these injunctions, Harry turned to Cortes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What do you intend to do?" he asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We have no rope," said the guide.  "Fernando is at least fifty feet
from the path above, and there is no rope fifty feet in length nearer
to this place than Kano or Sokoto.  However, there is--as you know--a
rope-like creeper that grows in the bush.  I intend to go back as far
as the jungle."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Can you get there in time?" asked Braid, incredulously.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My wound is now healed," said the man, "my strength returned.  I can
but do my best."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Cortes looked up again at his brother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Courage!" he cried.  "In two days I return."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So saying, he bounded off upon his way.  As they watched him pass down
the valley, springing from rock to rock, it was apparent that he meant
to do all that was humanly possible to effect the salvation of his
brother.  Even as they looked, his figure grew smaller in the distance,
and in a few minutes he was lost to view.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To describe in detail the journey of the younger guide across the
mountains would be tedious.  The thing can be summed up in a few words:
it was magnificent, heroic.  Mile upon mile he covered without pausing
for breath.  For the most part he kept to the valleys, where the
atmosphere was stifling and humid, crossing the mountains only when by
doing so he could cut off several miles.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He had food with him, but he seldom stopped to eat.  Now and again he
drank at a mountain stream, but seemed to grudge the time even for this.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At sunset he was still bearing onward.  He had cast aside the greater
part of his clothing, and the perspiration poured off him, and the
veins stood out upon his temples like knotted strands of cord.  For all
that, he went on and on beneath the stars, whilst the moon marched in
the heavens.  It was a race for the life of his brother.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As Cortes hastened on his way, his thoughts continually went back to
the perilous situation in which he had left Fernando, and every thought
was, as it were, a spur to his endeavour.  No sooner had he pictured in
his mind's eye that struggling, writhing figure, hanging, as it were,
betwixt earth and sky, than he shot forward with renewed energy,
clenching both fists and teeth in his strong determination.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At last, breathless, exhausted, he sighted the extremity of the great
West African bush.  Through this, forcing his way among the thickets,
so that the sharp thorns tore his naked flesh, he was obliged to travel
for many miles before he found the right kind of creeping plant, and,
moreover, one long enough to suit his purpose.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To cut this from the tree around which it was twined, and roll it into
a great coil which he suspended around his neck, was the work of not
many minutes; and then he set forth upon his return journey to the
margin of the desert.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was already much exhausted, and his load was very heavy.  But hour
by hour he struggled onward, leaving the jungle far behind, mounting to
higher altitudes.  Nightfall found him still upon his way.  Repeatedly
he stumbled, and then, on a sudden, he fell full length upon the ground.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He lay quite still for several seconds, then rose slowly to his knees,
lifting his eyes and hands towards the stars.  For a moment he prayed
silently; and, seeming to gather courage from his prayer, he rose to
his feet and went on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Soon after midnight the sky became overcast.  A high wind got up and
blew from the mountains, bitter cold after the tropic heat of the bush.
Then the skies opened and the rain came down in sheets.  But Cortes
still held on, struggling towards his goal, fighting manfully against
his own failing strength.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And in the meantime, throughout these two fearful days, Jim Braid and
Harry waited in suspense.  They could do nothing to help the man who
hung, hour after hour, upon the brink of the other world.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Acting on his brother's advice, Fernando had undone the belt around his
waist, and with this had lashed himself to the stoutest branch of the
tree.  Words fail to describe the torture he must have suffered; for,
not only did he endure great pain from his broken arm, but he was
tormented by a raging thirst.  His cries for water were piteous to hear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They had no means of assisting him.  They could do nothing but look on
in helplessness, praying for the return of the younger brother.  On the
second night the rain came--in torrents, as it can only rain in the
tropics--and Fernando was able to moisten his parched lips by sucking
his drenched clothes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Wishing to get nearer to the poor fellow, in the hope that they might
be able to comfort him, at least with words, Harry and Jim Braid
climbed the spur and moved along the ledge at the top of the precipice
until they were immediately above the withered tree.  There, lying down
upon their faces, they cried out to him to be of good courage,
reminding him that the dawn approached, that his brother would soon
return.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Daybreak is the hour when Life is nearest Death.  It was shortly before
sunrise that Fernando himself gave up all hope, and called upon God to
take charge of his departing soul.  He said that he was quite ready to
welcome Death; he desired nothing more than to have an end to his
misery and suspense.  And, even as the words left his lips, the figure
of his brother was seen approaching along the ledge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the feet of Harry Urquhart, Cortes sank, exhausted.  The object of
his mission fulfilled, he lost consciousness and drifted into a faint.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With all dispatch they uncoiled the long, snake-like creeper.  Passing
one end over a jutting pinnacle of rock, they lowered the other towards
Fernando.  It was more than long enough to reach the place where he lay.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With great difficulty the poor fellow managed to untie his belt and
make fast the end of the creeper around his waist.  And then they had
to wait a long time, until Cortes, who had recovered consciousness, was
able to assist the two boys in hauling up the rope.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was no easy matter, since they had neither a good foothold nor
much space upon the terrace.  But in the end they succeeded, and the
rescued man lay panting on the ledge.  He was immediately given water
to drink; and when he had drunk, a smile slowly overspread his face,
and he looked at the brother who had saved his life.  But no word of
gratitude ever passed his lips; his thanks--far more eloquent than
words--were in his eyes.  And the dark eyes of a half-caste are the
most expressive and the most beautiful in the world.</span></p>
