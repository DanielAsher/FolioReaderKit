<p class="pfirst"><span>In less than a minute the bungalow was crowded.  Close upon the
head-gamekeeper's heels came one of his assistants, and after him Mr.
Langton himself and Harry, followed by several servants from the house.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When John Braid heard von Hardenberg's words, accusing his son of
theft, it was as if a blow had been struck him.  He looked about him
like a man dazed, and then carried a hand across his eyes.  Then,
without a word, he went down upon his knees at his son's side and
examined the wounded boy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He's not dead," said he in a husky voice.  "I can feel his heart
distinctly."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was at this moment that the Judge rushed into the room.  His bare
feet were encased in bedroom slippers; he was dressed in a shirt and a
pair of trousers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Whatever has happened?" he exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He repeated the question several times before anyone answered, and by
then the room was full.  The chauffeur was sent back post-haste to the
stables, with orders to drive for a doctor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How did it happen, John?" repeated Mr. Langton.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the gamekeeper shook his head.  He had the look of a man who is not
completely master of his senses.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Judge regarded his nephew.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Carl," said he, "can you explain how this--accident occurred?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Certainly!" said von Hardenberg, who now realized, that to save
himself, all his presence of mind was necessary.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then," said the Judge, "be so good as to do so."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"After my yesterday's interview with you," von Hardenberg began, in
tones of complete assurance, "as you may imagine, I had several letters
to write, and to-night I did not think of getting into bed till nearly
twelve o'clock.  Before I began to undress I went to the window and
opened it.  As I did so I saw a man cross the lawn and enter the woods.
As his conduct was suspicious, I took him for a poacher.  As quickly as
possible I left the house and walked in the direction I knew the man
had taken."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why did not you wake any of us?" asked the Judge, who was in his own
element, and might have been examining a witness in the box.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Von Hardenberg, however, did not appear to be the least alarmed.  He
answered his uncle slowly, but without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"For the very simple reason," said he, "that I did not wish to make a
fool of myself.  I half expected that the man would prove to be a
gamekeeper."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then why did you follow him?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"For two reasons.  First, because I wanted to satisfy myself as to who
he was, and, secondly, because a man who has just learnt he is to
remain a pauper for life does not, as a rule, feel inclined for sleep.
I wanted to go out into the air."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well," asked the Judge, "and then what happened?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I was unable to find the man in the woods, until I heard a noise in
the direction of the bungalow.  To the bungalow, accordingly I went, as
quickly as I could.  I got there in time to see him break open the door
with a crowbar.  There is the crowbar in his hand."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Everyone in the room caught his breath.  Such an accusation against Jim
Braid was almost incomprehensible.  The boy was believed to be
perfectly honest and trustworthy; and yet, as Captain von Hardenberg
had said, there was the crowbar in his hand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And then?" prompted the judge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And then," the Prussian continued, "I watched him enter the room.  I
could see him through the window.  He went straight to your desk, took
the cash-box, and burst it open with the crowbar.  There is the box
lying on the floor.  If you examine it, you will see that I speak the
truth."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The judge picked up the box and looked at it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are prepared to swear to this?" he asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In a court of law," said the other--and never flinched.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was the Judge himself who emptied Jim's pockets, and there sure
enough he found the sovereigns which had been taken from the cash-box.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I would never have believed it!" he exclaimed.  "It's terrible to
think that one of my own servants should have treated me thus!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was then that Harry Urquhart spoke for the first time.  He could not
stand by and see his old friend so basely accused and not offer a word
in his defence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It's a lie!" he cried, his indignation rising in a flood.  "A base,
unmitigated lie!  Uncle," he pleaded, "you don't believe it, surely?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Judge shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It would be very foolish for me," said he, "to give an opinion one way
or the other, before the boy has had a chance to speak in his own
defence.  I must admit, however, that the evidence is very strong
against him."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A hurdle was fetched, upon which a mattress was laid; and upon this the
wounded boy was carried to the house, which was nearer to the bungalow
than his father's cottage.  By a strange coincidence, it was one of the
very hurdles that Jim had been setting up that afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The doctor, who lived at some distance, did not arrive for an hour.
After a short examination of the patient he was able to give a
satisfactory report.  The gun had gone off at too close a range to
allow the shot to scatter, and only about a quarter of the pellets had
entered the boy's side, the rest tearing a great hole in his coat and
waistcoat.  The wound was large and gaping, but no artery was touched,
and before they reached the house, and Jim had been laid upon the bed
in Harry's room, the patient had recovered consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For all that, it was several days before the doctor would allow him to
see anyone.  He was to be kept perfectly quiet, and not excited in any
way.  During that time he was attended with the greatest care, not only
by the housekeeper and Harry Urquhart, but by Mr. Langton himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the end of a week, a naturally strong constitution, and the good
health resulting from a life that is lived in the open air, had done
their work, and Jim was allowed to get up.  It was soon after that that
the Judge heard the case in his dining-room, where, seated at the head
of the table, pen in hand, he might have been back in his old place in
the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jim Braid--who, in very truth, was the prisoner in the dock--was seated
on a chair, facing the Judge.  On either side of the table were those
whom Mr. Langton proposed to call as witnesses--namely, Captain von
Hardenberg, John Braid, and the under-gamekeeper.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The face of the prisoner in the dock was white as a sheet.  Harry
Urquhart stood behind his uncle's chair, regarding his old friend with
commiseration in his eyes and a deep sympathy in his heart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Von Hardenberg's evidence differed in no material points from what he
had said before.  Indeed, he played his cards with almost fiendish
cunning.  The circumstantial evidence was all against the boy.  The
Judge had not yet discovered that the Sunstone was missing.  There was
no doubt that both the door of the bungalow and the cash-box had been
broken open by the crowbar--moreover, the very crowbar which the Judge
himself had seen in Jim's hands on the afternoon of the crime.  Neither
John Braid nor any other gamekeeper could do anything but bear out the
testimony of von Hardenberg.  When they entered the bungalow the boy's
guilt had seemed manifest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In his own defence Jim could state as much of the truth as he knew.  He
said that he had seen von Hardenberg break into the bungalow; he swore
that he had lent him the crowbar that very day.  Asked why he supposed
the Judge's nephew had become a burglar, he was unable to give an
answer.  From his position he had not been able to see into the room;
he had not the slightest idea what von Hardenberg did immediately after
entering.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All this the Judge flatly refused to believe.  He protested that it was
ridiculous to suppose that a young man of von Hardenberg's position
would rifle a cash-box, containing about twenty pounds.  In Mr.
Langton's opinion, the case was proved against the boy; he could not
doubt that he was guilty.  He said that he would refrain from
prosecuting, since John Braid had served him faithfully for many years,
but he was unwilling any longer to employ Jim on the estate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Mr. Langton had finished, John Braid asked for permission to
speak, and then turned upon his son with a savage fierceness that was
terrible to see.  He disowned him; he was no longer a son of his.  He
pointed out the benefits Jim had received at the hands of Mr. Langton,
and swore that he had never dreamed that such ingratitude was possible.
As far as he was concerned, he had done with his son, once and for all.
He would blot out his memory.  Henceforward Jim could fend for himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Still weak from his wounds, and with a far greater pain in his heart
than ever came from physical hurt, the boy rose to his feet and slowly
and in silence left the room.  He went to his father's cottage, and
there saw his mother, from whom he parted in tears.  Then, shouldering
the few belongings he possessed, done up in a bundle that he proposed
to carry on the end of a stick, he went his way down the drive of
Friar's Court.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He had not gone far before he heard footsteps approaching, and,
turning, beheld Harry Urquhart, running forward in haste.  The boy
waited until his friend had come up with him.  He tried to speak, but
found that impossible.  Something rose in his throat and choked his
power of utterance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You believe in me?" said he at last.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I do," cried Harry, "and I always will!  I know that you are innocent!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Thank you for that, sir!" said Jim.  "I can go my way with a lighter
heart."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Where are you going?" asked Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I don't know, sir, and I don't think I care.  Anywhere, so long as I
can get away from this place where I am suspected and despised!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Have you any money?" asked Harry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jim shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Here you are.  Take this.  It's all I have."  And Harry thrust into
his friend's hand a five-pound note.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Jim hesitated to take it; but in the end he did so, folding it
carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"God bless you, sir!" said he.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I'll make it my life's work," cried Harry, "to prove your innocence.
I'm confident I will succeed in the end.  For the present, good-bye!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good-bye!" said the other.  He dared not look young Urquhart in the
face, for his eyes were filling fast with tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then he went his way, throwing himself upon the mercy of the world,
with life before him to be started all anew.  Under his own name, and
with his old surroundings, he was disinherited, disowned, and
dishonoured.  He must find some new employment.  He must endeavour to
forget and to live down the past.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the gate of the drive he came into the highroad, and, turning his
face towards London, set forward, walking as quickly as he could.</span></p>
