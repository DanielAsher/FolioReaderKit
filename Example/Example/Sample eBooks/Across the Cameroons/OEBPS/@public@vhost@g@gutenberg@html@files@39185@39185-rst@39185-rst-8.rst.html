<p class="pfirst"><span>They experienced rough weather in the Bay of Biscay, where the ship
pitched and rolled in a confused sea, and the wind howled round
Finisterre, which was wrapped in an impenetrable fog.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two days afterwards they found the blue waters that bound the Morocco
coast, after which the heat became excessive.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The ship was bound first for Sierra Leone, and thence to Old Calabar,
from which place they intended to strike inland through the bush, after
engaging the services of a party of Kru boys to act as carriers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On these still tropic seas, dazzling in the sunshine, there was no sign
of war, except an occasional torpedo-boat destroyer which flew past
them at a speed of thirty knots an hour.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At Sierra Leone, Harry betook himself to a certain gentleman holding an
influential position in the Civil Service, to whom he had a letter of
introduction from his uncle, and who received the boy with courtesy and
kindness.  It was from that Harry learned that the Germans had been
driven back in Togoland, and that active operations were in progress in
the valley of the Cameroon River.  He himself had travelled far in the
interior; and in consequence he was able to give the boy invaluable
advice concerning the kit and equipment he would need to take with him
upon his expedition.  He advised him to strike into the bush from Old
Calabar, where he could procure servants and guides; if he went to
Victoria he would find his hands tied by those in command of the
Expeditionary Force, who had no liking for civilians at the front.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"All the same," he added, "I strongly advise you not to endeavour to
enter Maziriland."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Harry smiled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am afraid, sir," said he, "I have no option.  My duty takes me
there."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Of course," said the other, "I don't know what this duty may be, but I
tell you frankly the country is by no means safe.  All the natives are
in arms, some purchased by rum by the Germans, others loyal to us.  In
the old days the Cameroon kings implored the British Government to take
the country under its protection.  In their own words, they wanted
English laws.  But the Government took no notice of them until it was
too late, until the Germans had forestalled us and taken possession of
the country, by buying over the chiefs.  If you go into the bush, you
run into a thousand dangers: yellow fever, malaria, even starvation,
and the natives you encounter may sell you as prisoners to the Germans.
Some of them will do anything for drink."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Harry explained that he was prepared to take the gravest risks, since
the object of his journey was of more than vital importance, and
shortly afterwards took his leave, returning to the ship.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They had brought with them all they needed in the way of provisions,
clothing, arms and ammunition; and at Old Calabar they purchased a
canoe and engaged the services of six stalwart Kru boys.  Harry's idea
was to travel up-river, crossing the Cameroon frontier west of Bamenda,
and thence striking inland towards the mountains in northern German
territory, beyond which the Caves of Zoroaster were said to be.  They
also interviewed an interpreter, a half-caste Spaniard from Fernando
Po, who assured them he could speak every native dialect of the
Hinterland, from Lagos to the Congo, as well as English and German.
This proved to be no exaggeration.  Urquhart was assured that the man
was indeed a wonderful linguist, and, moreover, that he could be
trusted implicitly as a guide--the more so since he hated the Germans,
who had destroyed his 'factory' to make room for a house for a Prussian
Governor, who had hoped to rule the West Coast native with the iron
discipline of Potsdam.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This man--who called himself "Fernando" after the place of his
birth--said that he would never venture across the Cameroons to
Maziriland unless his brother was engaged to come with him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He explained that this brother of his was younger and more agile than
himself.  Before they became traders they had been hunters, in the old
days when the West Coast was practically unexplored, and they had
worked together hand-in-glove.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Accordingly, it was agreed that both brothers should join the
expedition; and when they presented themselves before Harry Urquhart,
the young Englishman could hardly refrain from smiling at their
personal appearance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They were plainly half-castes, and, like most such, considered
themselves Europeans, though neither had ever set eyes upon the
northern continent.  Though they were almost as black of skin as a Kru
boy, they wore large pith helmets, suits of white ducks and blue
puttees, being dressed to a button exactly the same.  Both wore brown
leather belts from which depended revolver holsters and cartridge
pouches.  The one was robust, wrinkled, broad of chest, and upright;
the other, stooping, tall, and abnormally thin.  There was a
business-like air about them both that appealed to Harry; and this
favourable impression was by no means dispelled when the brothers, in
quite tolerable English, raved against the Germans, who, they swore,
had bought the Cameroons with rum, in order to manage the country to
their own profit without regard to the welfare of the natives.  It was
owing to the German occupation of the Cameroons that Fernando and his
brother--who went by the name of Cortes--had been ruined by the
State-aided German factories that had sprung up as if by magic in the
early 'nineties.  Later, they had been accused of inciting the natives
to rebellion, heavily fined, and banished from the country.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This increase in numbers necessitated the purchase of a second canoe.
Before leaving Calabar they supplemented their commissariat with a new
supply of provisions; and, a few days after, it was a small but
well-equipped and dauntless expedition that set forth up-river in the
sweltering heat, making straight for the heart of the great West
African bush and the very stronghold of the enemy's position.</span></p>
