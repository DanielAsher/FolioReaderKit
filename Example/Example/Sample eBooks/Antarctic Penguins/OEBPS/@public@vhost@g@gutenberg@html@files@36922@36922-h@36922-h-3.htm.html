<p>A dead silence would ensue till a few seconds later, when they would all come to the surface some twenty or thirty yards out, and start rolling about and splashing in the water, cleaning themselves and making sounds exactly like a lot of boys calling out and chaffing one another.</p>
<p>So extraordinary was this whole scene, that on first witnessing it we were overcome with astonishment, and it seemed to us almost impossible that the little creatures, whose antics we were watching, were actually birds and not human beings. Seemingly reluctant as they had been to enter the water, when once there they evinced every sign of enjoyment, and would stay in for hours at a time.</p>
<p>As may be imagined, the penguins spent a great deal of time on their way to and from the water, especially during the earlier period before the sea-ice had broken away from the ice-foot, as they had so far to walk before arriving at the open leads.</p>
<p><a id="Page_76" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="76"></a>As a band of spotless bathers returning to the rookery, their white breasts and black backs glistening with a fine metallic lustre in the sunlight, met a dirty and bedraggled party on its way out from the nesting ground, frequently both would stop, and the clean and dirty mingle together and chatter with one another for some minutes. If they were not speaking words in some language of their own, their whole appearance belied them, and as they stood, some in pairs, some in groups of three or more, chattering amicably together, it became evident that they were sociable animals, glad to meet one another, and, like many men, pleased with the excuse to forget for a while their duties at home, where their mates were waiting to be relieved for their own spell off the nests.</p>
<p>After a variable period of this intercourse, the two parties would separate and continue on their respective ways, a clean stream issuing from the crowd in the direction of the rookery, a dirty one heading off towards the open water, but here it was seen that a few who had bathed and fed, and were already perhaps half-way home, had been persuaded to turn and accompany the others, and so back they would go again over the way they <a id="Page_77" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="77"></a> had come, to spend a few more hours in skylarking and splashing about in the sea.</p>

<p>In speaking of these games of the penguins, I wish to lay emphasis on the fact that these hours of relaxation play a large part in their lives during the advanced part of the breeding period. They would spend hours in playing at a sort of “touch last” on the sea-ice near the water's edge. They never played on the ground of the rookery itself, but only on the sea-ice and the ice-foot and in the water, and I may here mention another favourite pastime of theirs. I have said that the tide flowed past the rookery at the rate of some five or six knots. Small ice-floes are continually drifting past in the water, and as one of these arrived at the top of the ice-foot, it would be boarded by a crowd of penguins, sometimes until it could hold no more. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_39" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 39.</a>) This “excursion boat,” as we used to call it, would float its many occupants down the whole length of the ice-foot, and if it passed close to the edge, those that rode on the floes would shout at the knots of penguins gathered along the ice-foot (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_40" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 40</a>) who would shout at them in reply, so that a gay bantering seemed to accompany their passage past the rookery.</p>
<p><a id="Page_78" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="78"></a>Arrived at the farther end, some half a mile lower down, those on the “excursion boat” had perforce to leave it, all plunging into the tide and swimming against this until they came to the top again, then boarded a fresh floe for another ride down. All day these floes, often crowded to their utmost capacity, would float past the rookery. Often a knot of hesitating penguins on the ice-foot, on being hailed by a babel of voices from a floe, would suddenly make the plunge, and all swim off to join their friends for the rest of the journey, and I have seen a floe so crowded that as a fresh party boarded it on one side, many were pushed off the other side into the water by the crush.</p>
<p>Once, as we stood watching the penguins bathing, one of them popped out of the water on to the ice with a large pebble in its mouth, which it had evidently fetched from the bottom. This surprised me, as the depth of the sea here was some ten fathoms at least. The bird simply dropped the stone on the ice and then dived in again, so that evidently he had gone to all the trouble of diving for the stone simply for the pleasure of doing it. Mr. J. H. Gurney, in his book on the gannet, says they (gannets) are said to have got themselves <a id="Page_79" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="79"></a> entangled in fishing-nets at a depth of 180 ft. and that their descent to a depth of 90 ft. is quite authentic, so that perhaps the depth of this penguin's dive was not an unusual one.</p>

<p class="right">(<a class="c4 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#Page_80" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Page 80</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The tide at the open water leads where they bathed ran a good six knots, but the Adélies swam quite easily against this without leaving the surface.</p>
<p>In the water, as on the land, they have two means of progression. The first is by swimming as a duck swims, excepting that they lie much lower in the water than a duck does, the top of the back being submerged, so that the neck sticks up out of the water. As their feet are very slightly webbed, they have not the advantages that a duck or gull has when swimming in this way, but supplement their foot-work by short quick strokes of their flippers. This they are easily able to do, owing to the depth to which the breast sinks in the water.</p>
<p>The second method is by “porpoising.”</p>
<p>This consists in swimming under water, using the wings or “flippers” for propulsion, the action of these limbs being practically the same as they would be in flying. As their wings are beautifully shaped for swimming, and their pectoral muscles extraordinarily powerful, they attain great speed, besides which they are as nimble as fish, being able completely <a id="Page_80" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="80"></a> to double in their tracks in the flash of a moment. In porpoising, after travelling thirty feet or so under water, they rise from it, shooting clean out with an impetus that carries them a couple of yards in the air, then with an arch of the back they are head first into the water again, swimming a few more strokes, then out again, and so on.</p>
<p>I show a photograph of them doing this (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_49" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 49</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising feat of which the Adélie is capable is seen when it leaps from the water on to the ice. We saw this best later in the year when the sea-ice had broken away from the ice-foot, so that open water washed against the ice cliff bounding the land. This little cliff rose sheer from the water at first, but later, by the action of the waves, was under-cut for some six feet or more in places, so that the ledge of ice at the top hung forwards over the water. The height of most of this upper ledge varied from three to six feet.</p>
<div class="figcenter page-break-fig page-break-after-fig c6"><a id="fig_50"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@images@fig50.jpg" alt="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></a>

<p>Whilst in the water the penguins usually hunted and played in parties, just as they had entered it, though a fair number of solitary individuals were also to be seen. When a party had satisfied their appetites and their desire for play, they would swim to a distance of some thirty to forty yards from the <a id="Page_81" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="81"></a> ice-foot, when they might be seen all to stretch their necks up and take a good look at the proposed landing-place. Having done this, every bird would suddenly disappear beneath the surface, not a ripple showing which direction they had taken, till suddenly, sometimes in a bunch, sometimes in a stream, one after the other they would all shoot out of the water, clean up on to the top of the ice-foot. (Figs. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_41" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">41</a> and <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_42" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">42</a>.) Several times I measured the distance from the surface of the water to the ledge on which they landed, and the highest leap I recorded was exactly five feet. The “take off” was about four feet out from the edge, the whole of the necessary impetus being gained as the bird approached beneath the water.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note about this jumping from the water was the accuracy with which they invariably rose at precisely the right moment, the exact distance being judged during their momentary survey of a spot from a distance, before they dived beneath the water, and carried in their minds as they approached the ice. I am sure that this impression was all they had to guide them, as with a ripple on the water, and at the pace they were going, they could not possibly have seen their landing-place at all clearly as they approached it, <a id="Page_82" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="82"></a> besides which, in many cases, the ledge of ice on which they landed projected many feet forwards from the surface, yet I never saw them misjudge their distance so as to come up under the overhanging ledge.</p>
<p>During their approach they swam at an even distance of about three or four feet beneath the surface, projecting themselves upwards by a sudden upward bend of the body, at the same time using their tail as a helm, in the manner well shown in one of my photographs, in which one of the birds is seen in the air at the moment it left the water, the tail being bent sharply up towards the back.</p>
<p>Their quickness of perception is shown very well as they land on the ice. If the surface is composed of snow, and so affords them a good foothold, they throw their legs well forward and land on their feet, as shown in Figs. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_41" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">41</a> and <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_42" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">42</a>, but should they find themselves landing on a slippery ice-surface, they throw themselves forward, landing on their breasts in the tobogganing position as shown in <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_43" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 43</a>.</p>
<p>The Adélies dive very beautifully. We did not see this at first, before the sea-ice had gone out, because to enter the water they had only to drop <a id="Page_83" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="83"></a> a few inches, but later, when entering from the ice terraces, we constantly saw them making the most graceful dives.</p>
<div class="figcenter page-break-fig page-break-after-fig c6"><a id="fig_51"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@images@fig51.jpg" alt="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></a>

<p>At the place where they most often went in, a long terrace of ice about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice, crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks over the edge (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_44" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 44</a>), and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.</p>
<p>When diving into shallow water they fall flat (Figs. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-2.htm.html#fig_45" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">45</a>, <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_46" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">46</a>, and <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_47" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">47</a>), but into deep water, and from any considerable height, they assume the most perfect positions (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_50" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 50</a>) and make very little splash. Occasionally we saw them stand hesitating to dive at a height of some twenty feet, but generally they descended to some lower spot, and did not often dive from such a height, but twelve feet was no uncommon dive for them.</p>
<p>The reluctance shown by each individual of a party of intending bathers to be the first to enter the water may partly have been explained when, later on, we discovered that a large number of sea-leopards were gathered in the sea in the neighbourhood <a id="Page_84" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="84"></a> of the rookery to prey on the penguins. These formidable animals, of which I show some photographs, used to lurk beneath the overhanging ledges of the ice-foot, out of sight of the birds on the ice overhead. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_51" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 51.</a>) They lay quite still in the water, only their heads protruding, until a party of Adélies would descend into the water almost on top of them, when with a sudden dash and snap of their great formidable jaws, they would secure one of the birds.</p>
<p>It seemed to me then, that all the chivvying and preliminaries which they went through before entering the water, arose mainly from a desire on the part of each penguin to get one of its neighbours to go in first in order to prove whether the coast was clear or not, though all this manœuvring was certainly taken very lightly, and quite in the nature of a game. This indeed was not surprising, for of all the animals of which I have had any experience, I think the Adélie penguin is the very bravest. The more we saw of them the fonder we became of them and the more we admired their indomitable courage. The appearance of a sea-leopard in their midst was the one thing that caused them any panic. With dozens of these enemies about they would gambol in the sea in the most light-hearted manner, <a id="Page_85" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="85"></a> but the appearance of one among them was the signal for a stampede, but even this was invariably gone through in an orderly manner with some show of reason, for, porpoising off in a clump, they at once spread themselves out, scattering in a fan-shaped formation as they sped away, instead of all following the same direction.</p>
<div class="figcenter page-break-fig page-break-after-fig c6"><a id="fig_52"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@images@fig52.jpg" alt="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></a>

<p>As far as I could judge, however, the sea-leopards are a trifle faster in the water than the Adélies, as one of them occasionally would catch up with one of the fugitives, who then, realizing that speed alone would not avail him, started dodging from side to side, and sometimes swam rapidly round and round in a circle of about twelve feet diameter for a full minute or more, doubtless knowing that he was quicker in turning than his great heavy pursuer, but exhaustion would overtake him in the end, and we could see the head and jaws of the great sea-leopard rise to the surface as he grabbed his victim. The sight of a panic-stricken little Adélie tearing round and round in this manner was a sadly common sight late in the season.</p>
<p>Sea-leopards are no mean customers and should be treated with caution. Commander Campbell and I used to hunt them from a little Norwegian pram (a species of dinghy) which we rowed quietly <a id="Page_86" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="86"></a> up and down close under the ice-foot, shooting at the sea-leopards with a rifle when we saw their heads above water.</p>
<p>One day we had an interesting little adventure. We had shot and killed one, a fine bull about ten feet long, which had sunk to the bottom in some five fathoms. Having just pulled away from him, we were about ten yards from the ice-foot, when another very large sea-leopard overtook us, swimming from the direction of the dead bull. It passed under the pram, bumping against the keel in doing so. When about ten yards ahead of us it turned and made straight back for us, but as we were bows-on to it, it came right alongside the boat, churning up the water and wetting us. At this moment it turned on its side, its right fore-flipper beating the surface and its belly towards us, and was just starting to rear its head up when we both lunged at it with our paddles, and so pushed the little boat away from it. This brought us alongside the ice-foot, from which Campbell got a shot at it half a minute later, and wounded it in the neck. The moment after we lunged at it with our paddles it dived, then reappeared ten or fifteen yards off, rearing its head out of the water, and it was at this moment that Campbell shot it. After this it <a id="Page_87" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="87"></a> reappeared several times at the surface, but drifted away with the tide and we lost it.</p>

<p>The sea-leopard has not a reputation for attacking men in boats, and this one may have been actuated by curiosity merely, but in favour of its meaning to attack us were, first, that it came to us straight from the direction of the dead bull we had shot, and secondly, that it seems hardly likely that after bumping against our keel, mere curiosity could have tempted it to come back and try to look over the gunwale! As a rule we had to drift very quietly along when hunting sea-leopards, as the slightest sound frightened them away.</p>
<p>All that we could do to protect our friends was to shoot as many of these sea-leopards as possible but though we may have made some difference, there were always many about.</p>
<p>Some idea of the depredations committed by these animals may be gathered from the fact that in the stomach of one which we shot I found the bodies of eighteen penguins, in various stages of digestion, the beast's intestines being literally stuffed with the feathers remaining from the disintegration of many more. Photographs of these animals are seen in Figs. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_52" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">52</a>, <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_53" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">53</a>, and <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_54" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">54</a>.</p>
<p>Though the actual presence of a sea-leopard <a id="Page_88" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="88"></a> put the Adélies to confusion, causing them to <ins title="‘porpoise">“porpoise</ins>” madly away for a few hundred yards, yet once away from the immediate neighbourhood of the arch enemy, they appeared to think no more of him, and behaved as though there were no further need for anxiety, though probably they kept a sharp look-out nevertheless. Evidence goes to show that the sea-leopard is the only living enemy, excepting man, that threatens the life of the adult Adélie penguin.</p>
<p>One day, as I watched some hundreds of Adélies bathing in an open lead, suddenly the back of an enormous killer-whale (<i xml:lang="la">Orca gladiator</i>) rose above the surface as it crossed the lead from side to side, appearing from beneath the ice on one side and disappearing beneath it on the other. To my surprise, not the slightest fear was shown by the birds in the water. Had this beast been a sea-leopard, there would have been a stampede, and every bird have leapt from the water on to the sea-ice. On this evidence I formed the opinion that in all probability killer-whales do no harm to Adélie penguins; later I saw it confirmed, when a school of killers shaved close past several floes that were crowded with Adélies, and made not the least attempt to get at them, as they might so easily <a id="Page_89" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="89"></a> have done by upsetting the floes. Very probably this is because the agile bird can escape with such ease from the ponderous whale, and fears it no more than a terrier fears a cow, though he thinks twice before coming within reach of its jaws.</p>

<p>When the sea-ice had gone out, leaving open water right up to the ice-foot, a ledge of ice was left along the western side of the rookery, forming a sort of terrace or “front,” with its sides composed of blue ice, rising sheer out of the water to a height of some six feet or more in places. From this point of vantage it was possible to stand and watch the penguins as they swam in the clear water below, and some idea was formed of their wonderful agility when swimming beneath the surface. As they propelled themselves along with powerful strokes of their wings, they swerved from side to side to secure the little prawn-like euphausia which literally swarm everywhere in the Antarctic seas, affording them ample food at all times. Their gluttonous habits here became very evident. They would gobble euphausia until they could hold no more, only to vomit the whole meal into the water as they swam, and so enlightened start to feast again. As they winged their way along, several feet beneath the surface, a milky cloud would <a id="Page_90" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="90"></a> suddenly issue from their mouths and drift slowly away down stream, as, without the slightest pause in their career, they dashed eagerly along in the hunt for more.</p>
<p>When a penguin returned to his mate on the nest, after his jaunt in the sea, much formality had to be gone through before he was allowed to take charge of the eggs. This ceremony of “relieving guard” almost invariably was observed.</p>
<p>Going up to his mate, with much graceful arching of his neck, he appeared to assure her in guttural tones of his readiness to take charge (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_55" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 55</a>). At this she would become very agitated, replying with raucous staccato notes, and refusing to budge from her position on the eggs. Then both would become angry for a while, arguing in a very heated manner, until at last she would rise, and, standing by the side of the nest, allow him to walk on to it, which he immediately did, and after carefully placing the eggs in position, sink down upon them, afterwards thrusting his bill beneath his breast to push them gently into a comfortable position. After staying by him for a little while, the other at length would go off to bathe and feed.</p>

<p>From the above Table it will be seen that the hen was not relieved by the cock until a fortnight after she had laid her egg (in this case there was only one) so that probably she had been without food for a month. Then she left, and only returned to relieve the cock after the lapse of another fortnight, it being worth remarking that each was absent for the same length of time. When the chick was hatched, a different régime began, as of course the chick had to be fed and journeys to the sea made at regular intervals for the purpose of getting food.</p>
<p>When the chicks began to appear all over the rookery (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_56" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 56</a>), a marked change was noticed in the appearance of the parents as they made their way on foot from the water's edge to the nests. Hitherto they had been merely remarkable for their spotless and glistening plumage, but now they <a id="Page_94" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="94"></a> were bringing with them food for the young, and so distended were their stomachs with this, that they had to lean backward as they walked, to counterbalance their bulging bellies, and in consequence frequently tripped over the inequalities of the ground which were thus hidden from their gaze.</p>
<p>What with the exertion of tramping with their burden across the rookery, and perhaps on rare occasions one or two little disputes with other penguins by the way, frequently they were in some distress before they reached their destination, and quite commonly they would be sick and bring up the whole offering before they got there. Consequently, little red heaps of mashed up and half digested euphausia were to be seen about the rookery. Once I saw a penguin, after he had actually reached the nest, quite unable to wait for the chick to help itself in the usual manner, deposit the lot upon the ground in front of his mate. I saw what was coming and secured the accompanying photograph of the incident. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_57" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 57.</a>) When this happens the food is wasted, as neither chick nor adult will touch it however hungry they may be, the former only feeding by the natural method of pushing his head down the throat of a parent, and so helping himself direct from the gullet.

<p>To see an Adélie chick of a fortnight's growth trying to get itself covered by its mother is a most ludicrous sight. The most it can hope for is to get its head under cover, the rest of its body being exposed to the air; but the downy coat of the chick is close and warm, and suffices in all weathers to protect it from the cold. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_60" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 60</a> illustrates what <a id="Page_96" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="96"></a> I have said very well, whilst <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-3.htm.html#fig_61" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 61</a> shows a mother with a chick twelve days old.</p>
<p>Whilst the chicks are small the two parents manage to keep them fed without much difficulty;<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_6" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">(6)</a> but as one of them has always to remain at the nest to keep the chicks warm, guard them from skuas and hooligan cocks, and prevent them from straying, only one is free to go for food. Later on, however, two other factors introduce themselves. The first of these is that the chick's downy coats become thick enough to protect them from cold without the warmth of the parent; and the second that as the chicks grow they require an ever-increasing quantity of food, and at the age of about a fortnight this demand becomes too great for one bird to cope with. At this time it is still necessary to prevent the chicks from straying and to protect them from the skuas and “hooligans,” and so to meet these two demands a most interesting social system is developed. The individual care of the chicks by their parents is abandoned, and in place of this, colonies start to “pool” their offspring, which are herded together into clumps or “crèches,” each of which is guarded by a few old birds, the rest being free to go and forage.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="Page_97" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="97"></a>It is quite likely that if a chick which has escaped from its own crèche joins another crèche it will get fed there, as it seems hardly possible for the adults to recognize the individuals of so large a gathering and to detect a stranger should one turn up, but there is good reason to believe that the old birds work for their own crèches only, and remain faithful to them for the rest of the season, because, as they make their way across the rookery, laden with the food they are bringing from the sea, it is sadly common to see them pursued by strayed and starving youngsters, plaintively piping their prayers for a meal; and these appeals are always made in vain, the old birds turning a deaf ear to the youngsters, who at last, weary and weak, give up the pursuit, and in the end fall a prey to the ever-watchful skuas. Further evidence is found in the fact that the chicks at the very back of the rookery and up at the top of the Cape are just as well nourished as those nearer the water, who are constantly passed by a stream of food-laden parents.</p>
<p>Twice already I have mentioned that strayed chicks fall a prey to “hooligan” cocks. These hang about the rookery often in little bands. At the beginning of the season there are very few of them, but later they increase greatly, do much <a id="Page_98" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="98"></a> damage, and cause a great deal of annoyance to the peaceful inhabitants. The few to be found at first probably are cocks who have not succeeded in finding mates, and consequently are “at a loose end.” Later on, as their numbers are so greatly increased, they must be widowers, whose mates have lost their lives in one way or another.</p>
<p>Many of the colonies, especially those nearer the water, are plagued by little knots of “hooligans,” who hang about their outskirts, and should a chick go astray it stands a good chance of losing its life at their hands. The crimes which they commit are such as to find no place in this book, but it is interesting indeed to note that, when nature intends them to find employment, these birds, like men degenerate in idleness.</p>
<p>Some way back I made some allusion to the way in which many of the penguins were choosing sites up the precipitous sides of the Cape at the back of the rookery. Later I came to the conclusion that this was purely the result of their love of climbing. There was one colony at the very summit of the Cape,<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_7" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">(7)</a> whose inhabitants could only reach their nests by a long and trying climb to the top and then a walk of some hundred yards across a steep <a id="Page_99" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="99"></a> snow slope hanging over the very brink of a sheer drop of seven hundred feet on to the sea-ice.</p>

<p>During the whole of the time when they were rearing their young, these mountaineers had to make several journeys during each twenty-four hours to carry their enormous bellyfuls of euphausia all the way from the sea to their young on the nests—a weary climb for their little legs and bulky bodies. The greater number who had undertaken this did so at a time when there were ample spaces unoccupied in the most eligible parts of the rookery.</p>
<p>I have mentioned that large masses of ice were stranded by the sea along the shores of the rookery. These fragments of bergs, some of them fifteen to twenty feet in height, formed a miniature mountain range along the shore. All day parties of penguins were to be seen assiduously climbing the steep sides of this little range. Time after time, when half way up, they would descend to try another route, and often when with much pains one had scaled a slippery incline, he would come sliding to the bottom, only to pick himself up and have another try. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@36922@36922-h@36922-h-4.htm.html#fig_63" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 63.</a>)</p>
<p>Generally, this climbing was done by small parties who had clubbed together, as they generally do, from social inclination. It was not unusual for <a id="Page_100" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="100"></a> a little band of climbers to take as much as an hour or more over climbing to the summit. Arrived at the top they would spend a variable period there, sometimes descending at once, sometimes spending a considerable time there, gazing contentedly about them, or peering over the edge to chatter with other parties below.</p>
<p>Again, about half a mile from the beach, a large berg some one hundred feet in height was grounded in fairly deep water, accessible at first over the sea-ice, but later, when this had gone, surrounded by open water. Its sides were sheer except on one side, which sloped steeply from the water's edge to the top.</p>
<p>From the time when they first went to the sea to feed until the end of the season, there was a continual stream of penguins ascending and descending the berg. As I watched them through glasses I saw that they had worn deep paths in the snow from base to summit. They had absolutely nothing to gain by going to all this trouble but the pleasure they seemed to derive from the climb, and when at the top, merely had a good look round and came down again.</p>

<p>When the birds were arriving at the rookery I watched for those who were to nest up the cliff, and several times saw birds on arriving at the rookery <a id="Page_101" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="101"></a> make for the heights without any hesitation, threading their way almost in a straight line through the nests to the screes at the bottom of the cliff, and up these to one or other of the paths leading up its side. Probably these had been hatched there, or had nested there before, and were making their way to their old haunts, but my notes on their nesting habits go to show that the cocks, at any rate, cannot keep to the same spot during successive years. It is the hen who chooses the site, and stays on it, as I have shown, until a mate comes to her, and wins her, very often only after defeating many other competitors.</p>
