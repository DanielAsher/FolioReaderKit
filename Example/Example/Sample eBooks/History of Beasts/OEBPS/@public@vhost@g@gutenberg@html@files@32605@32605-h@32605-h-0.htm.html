THE CAT</h2>
<p><ins class="TN" title="invisible in original; inferred">The</ins> cat is a very useful do<ins class="TN" title="original only shows 'do-'; remainder inferred">mestic</ins> animal. She destroys <ins class="TN" title="all but 's' invisible in original; inferred, having regard to amount of blank space">the rat</ins>s and mice, which otherwise would do much injury. God has formed her to live among men. How soft her fur is! How quietly she lies and purs when she is treated kindly! How patiently she will sit, for many hours together, and watch for her prey! It would be well if little boys and girls would sit as still while they are learning their lessons.</p>

THE DOG.</h2>
<p>The Dog takes care of his master’s property; he follows him about, and will not let any body hurt him. Should a stranger come, he barks, to let his master know it. He is easily taught a great many useful things.<!-- period invisible in original --> A shepherd’s dog will not let the sheep go astray. It would be well if little boys and girls were always as faithful to their parents as the dog is to his master.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00004"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.006" id="png.006" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-006.png" alt="cow" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE COW.</h2>
<p>The cow is a very valuable animal, and useful in many ways. I dare say you like to have her milk for breakfast, and to eat sometimes a piece of beef at dinner. The skin is tanned and made into shoes; the horns are made into many useful articles; the bones make combs, and many other things, nearly as well as ivory; the hair is used in making mortar, with which our houses are plastered and made warm. How wonderfully has God provided for the convenience of man.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00005"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.007" id="png.007" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-007.png" alt="fox" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE FOX.</h2>
<p>The Fox is a cunning and mischievous animal. He is troublesome to the farmer, frequently killing his geese and chickens. People are obliged to go, in great numbers, sometimes, to hunt them out of their holes and hiding places.—Do you remember what our Saviour said of himself? “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.“</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00006"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.008" id="png.008" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-008.png" alt="goat" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE GOAT.</h2>
<p>The Goat is a useful animal when tamed, and it is very cruel for little boys to teaze them. Their milk is very wholesome, though not as good as that of the cow. “The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats.” When Saul persecuted David, he was forced to hide among the rocks where the goats were found. Read 1 Samuel, xxiv. 2.<!-- final period invisible in original --></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00007"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.009" id="png.009" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-009.png" alt="horse" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE HORSE.</h2>
<p>The horse is a noble and useful animal. He is very strong and active. The Psalmist says, “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of our God.” This is to teach us not to trust in any thing in this world, however good or great it may be, but to look to God alone for strength and protection.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00008"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.010" id="png.010" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-010.png" alt="ass" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE ASS</h2>
<p>In eastern countries, the Ass is a much larger and stronger animal than it is here. It is not easily tamed, but it is very useful, and one of the most patient of beasts when it is tamed. Job says, “Vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass’s colt.” Job, xi. 24. For we are all naturally inclined to do what is evil and wrong, unless our hearts are subdued by the power of divine grace.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00009"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.011" id="png.011" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-011.png" alt="lamb" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE LAMB.</h2>
<p>In the Bible, Christ is compared to a lamb, because lambs were sacrificed as an offering for sin. John the Baptist pointed out Christ to his disciples, and said, “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.”—Think upon what Christ suffered for you, and pray that you may love him, and that he would cause you to hate sin, and to do his will.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00010"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.012" id="png.012" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-012.png" alt="sheep" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE SHEEP.</h2>
<p>When Sheep wander from their fold, they will not find their way back again at night, unless they are driven home. Dogs, and many other animals, can find their way home, but sheep cannot find their way to their fold. “All we, like sheep have gone astray.” Christ is the good Shepherd; he will take care of those who love him; for he laid down his life for his sheep.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00011"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.013" id="png.013" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-013.png" alt="lion" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE LION.</h2>
<p>The Lion is one of the strongest and fiercest of wild beasts. The Bible says, “The righteous are bold as a lion.” But wicked men are strong also: the Psalmist prayed that God would “save him from the lion’s mouth.” You recollect about Daniel in the lions’ den;—God sent an angel and shut the lions’ mouths.</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00012"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.014" id="png.014" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-014.png" alt="tiger" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE TIGER.</h2>
<p>The Tiger is a native of Africa. He is a very fierce beast. Angry persons are often compared to the tiger; and certainly they resemble furious wild beasts. Perhaps they do not intend to do harm, but they often do a great deal of mischief; therefore “leave off contention before it be meddled with.”</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00013"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.015" id="png.015" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-015.png" alt="serpent" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE SERPENT</h2>
<p>“O what an ugly Serpent!” says some little boy or girl who is reading this book. Do you remember who it was that took the form of a serpent, and tempted our first parents to sin against God? Read the account of it in the third chapter of the book of Genesis; and remember, when you sin against God, you resemble the “old serpent, the Devil.”</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00014"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.016" id="png.016" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-016.png" alt="reindeer" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/><br/>
THE REINDEER.</h2>
<p>The Reindeer is an inhabitant of cold countries. The Laplanders find them very serviceable; they draw their sledges over the snow and ice for them, and their skins make a warm covering from the cold. How wonderful are the works of God!<!-- exclamation mark partially invisible in original -->
There is nothing made in vain.<!-- period invisible in original --></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00015"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.017" id="png.017" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]<br/></span></a><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@images@illo-017.png" alt="cross victorious" title="" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></h2>
<p>The prophet Isaiah tells us, that “the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.” Isaiah xi. These words foretell that <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@32605@32605-h@32605-h-0.htm.html#png.018" id="png.018" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="ns">[</span><span class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]</span></a> blessed time when Satan shall be chained for a thousand years, and Christ shall reign throughout the earth. That period is called the Millenium.</p>

be<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See<br/>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement<br/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br/>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.<br/><br/>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"<br/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<br/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with<br/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.<br/><br/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in<br/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning<br/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United<br/>States.<br/><br/>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project

the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees<br/>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the<br/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1<br/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8

paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional<br/>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked<br/>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with
