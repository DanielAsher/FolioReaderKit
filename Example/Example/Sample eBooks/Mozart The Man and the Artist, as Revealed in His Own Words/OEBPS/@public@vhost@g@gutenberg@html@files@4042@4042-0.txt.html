<p id="id00027">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produced over
two million dollars per hour this year as we released about 100 new
Etext files per month in 2001 for a total of about 4000+ etexts.
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.</p>

<h3 id="id00089" style="margin-top: 3em">BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</h3>

<p id="id00090" style="margin-top: 3em">The German composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) was not
only a musical genius, but was also one of the pre-eminent
geniuses of the Western world. He defined in his music a system
of musical thought and an entire state of mind that were unlike
any previously experienced. A true child prodigy, he began
composing at age 5 and rapidly developed his unmistakable style;
by 18 he was composing works capable of altering the mind-states
of entire civilizations. Indeed, he and his predecessor Bach
accomplished the Olympian feat of adding to the human concepts of
civility and civilization. So these two were not just musical
geniuses, but geniuses of the humanities.</p>

<p id="id00091">Mozart's music IS civilization. It encompasses all that is humane
about an idealized civilization. And it probably was Mozart's
main purpose to create and propagate a concept of a great
civilization through his music. He wanted to show his fellow
Europeans, with their garbage-polluted citystreets, their violent
mono-maniacal leaders and their stifling, non-humane bureaucracies,
new ideas on how to run their civilizations properly. He wanted
them to hear and feel a sense of civilized movement, of the
musical expressions of man moving as he would if upholding the
highest values of idealized societies. One need only listen to
the revolutionary opening bars of his famous Eine Kleine
Nachtmusik to see this.</p>

<p id="id00092">He was an extremely sophisticated and complex man. His letters
reveal him as remarkably creative, fascinated by the arts,
principled, religious and devoted to his father. He had an
energetic personality that was almost completely devoid of any
cynicism, pessimism or discouragement from creating music. While
rumors suggest that he was a lascivious individual, there is no
evidence of this at all in his letters. Quite the contrary, the
evidence seems overwhelmingly to suggest the opposite, and that
Mozart may not have had any relations with women except with his
own wife.</p>

<p id="id00093">He was not as shrewd as he was civilized, however. He was
peculiarly lax about profiting from his history-changing music.
His promoters constantly short-changed him.</p>

<p id="id00094">He died nearly penniless and in debt, and at his death at age 35
an apathetic public took little notice of this man who had done
so much in service to civilization. He was buried in an unmarked
pauper's grave with few mourners. After his death, the bones of
this great paragon of self-sacrifice for the sake of improving
civilization were dug up and disposed of. His grave was then
re-used, and to this day no one knows where his bones lie. Perhaps
they are in a catacomb somewhere, in a huge bone-pile containing
thousands of anonymous cadavers.</p>

<p id="id00095">But the sounds he heard in his head live on, stimulating millions
in elevators, doctors' offices, train terminals, concert halls
and myriad other places to be more civilized, assuming that they
pay attention to the music.</p>

<h3 id="id00096" style="margin-top: 3em">EDITOR'S NOTE</h3>

<p id="id00097" style="margin-top: 3em">The purpose and scope of this little book will be obvious to the
reader from even a cursory glance at its contents. It is, in a
way, an autobiography of Mozart written without conscious
purpose, and for that reason peculiarly winning, illuminating and
convincing. The outward things in Mozart's life are all but
ignored in it, but there is a frank and full disclosure of the
great musician's artistic, intellectual and moral character, made
in his own words.</p>

<p id="id00098">The Editor has not only taken the trouble to revise the work of
the German author and compiler, but, for reasons which seemed to
him imperative, has also made a new translation of all the
excerpts. Most of the translations of Mozart's letters which have
found their way into the books betray want of familiarity with
the idioms and colloquialisms employed by Mozart, as well as
understanding of his careless, contradictory and sprawling
epistolary style. Some of the intimacy of that style the new
translation seeks to preserve, but the purpose has chiefly been
to make the meaning plain.</p>

<h4 id="id00099" style="margin-top: 2em">H.E.K.</h4>

<p id="id00100" style="margin-top: 2em">New York, June 7, 1905</p>

<h3 id="id00101" style="margin-top: 3em">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOZART</h3>

<p id="id00102" style="margin-top: 3em">Mozart! What a radiance streams from the name! Bright and pure as
the light of the sun, Mozart's music greets us. We pronounce his
name and behold! the youthful artist is before us,—the merry,
light-hearted smile upon his features, which belongs only to true
and naive genius. It is impossible to imagine an aged Mozart,—an
embittered and saddened Mozart,—glowering gloomily at a wicked
world which is doing its best to make his lot still more
burdensome;—a Mozart whose music should reflect such painful
moods.</p>

<p id="id00103">Mozart was a Child of the Sun. Filled with a humor truly divine,
he strolled unconstrainedly through a multitude of cares like
Prince Tamino through his fantastic trials. Music was his
talisman, his magic flute with which he could exorcise all the
petty terrors that beset him. Has such a man and artist—one who
was completely resolved in his works, and therefore still stands
bodily before us with all his glorious qualities after the lapse
of a century—has Mozart still something to say to us who have
just stepped timidly into a new century separated by another from
that of the composer? Much; very much. Many prophets have arisen
since Mozart's death; two of them have moved us profoundly with
their evangel. One of them knew all the mysteries, and Nature
took away his hearing lest he proclaim too much. We followed him
into all the depths of the world of feeling. The other shook us
awake and placed us in the hurly-burly of national life and
striving; pointing to his own achievements, he said: "If you wish
it, you have now a German art!" The one was Beethoven,—the other
Wagner. Because their music demands of us that we share with it
its experiences and struggles, they are the guiding spirits of a
generation which has grown up in combat and is expecting an
unknown world of combat beyond the morning mist of the new
century.</p>

<p id="id00104">But we are in the case of the man in the fairy tale who could not
forget the merry tune of the forest bird which he had heard as a
boy. We gladly permit ourselves to be led, occasionally, out of
the rude realities that surround us, into a beautiful world that
knows no care but lies forever bathed in the sunshine of
cloudless happiness,—a world in which every loveliness of which
fancy has dreamed has taken life and form. It is because of this
that we make pilgrimages to the masterpieces of the plastic arts,
that we give heed to the speech of Schiller, listen to the music
of Mozart. When wearied by the stress of life we gladly hie to
Mozart that he may tell us stories of that land of beauty, and
convince us that there are other and better occupations than the
worries and combats of the fleeting hour. This is what Mozart has
to tell us today. In spite of Wagner he has an individual mission
to fulfill which will keep him immortal. "That of which Lessing
convinces us only with expenditure of many words sounds clear and
irresistible in 'The Magic Flute':—the longing for light and
day. Therefore there is something like the glory of daybreak in
the tones of Mozart's opera; it is wafted towards us like the
morning breeze which dispels the shadows and invokes the sun."</p>

<p id="id00105">Mozart remains ever young; one reason is because death laid hold
of him in the middle of his career. While all the world was still
gazing expectantly upon him, he vanished from the earth and left
no hope deceived. His was the enviable fate of a Raphael,
Schiller and Korner. As the German ('tis Schumann's utterance)
thinks of Beethoven when he speaks the word symphony, so the name
of Mozart in his mind is associated with the conception of things
youthful, bright and sunny. Schumann was fully conscious of a
purpose when he called out, "Do not put Beethoven in the hands of
young people too early; refresh and strengthen them with the
fresh and lusty Mozart." Another time he writes: "Does it not
seem as if Mozart's works become fresher and fresher the oftener
we hear them?"</p>

<p id="id00106">The more we realize that Wagner places a heavy and intoxicating
draught before us the more we shall appreciate the precious
mountain spring which laves us in Mozart's music, and the less
willing we shall be to permit any opportunity to pass unimproved
which offers us the crystal cup. In the mind of Goethe genius was
summed up in the name of Mozart. In a prophetic ecstasy he spoke
the significant words: "What else is genius than that productive
power through which deeds arise, worthy of standing in the
presence of God and Nature, and which, for this reason, bear
results and are lasting? All the creations of Mozart are of this
class; within them there is a generative force which is
transplanted from generation to generation, and is not likely
soon to be exhausted or devoured."</p>

words. It is plain to me that the composer had the classic
definition of the dance in mind when he said that he was no
dancer. The dance of which he was thinking was that described by
Charles Kingsley. "A dance in which every motion was a word, and
rest as eloquent as motion; in which every attitude was a fresh
motive for a sculptor of the purest school, and the highest
physical activity was manifested, not as in coarse pantomime, in
fantastic bounds and unnatural distortions, but in perpetual
delicate modulations of a stately and self-sustained grace."

violin, and a bit of the mass."</p>

thinking out the prelude."</p>

thought out a new composition. Concerning the fugue and its
origin he continues to gossip in the same letter.)</p>

dear Constanze. Baron von Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, let
me carry home all the works of Handel and Sebastian Bach after I
had played them through for him. Constanze fell in love with the
fugues as soon as she had heard them; she doesn't want to hear
anything but fugues, especially those of Handel and Bach. Having
often heard me improvise fugues she asked me if I had never
written any down, and when I said no, she gave me a good
scolding, for not being willing to write the most beautiful
things in music, and did not cease her begging until I had
composed one for her, and so it came about. I purposely wrote the
indication 'Andante maestoso,' so that it should not be played
too rapidly;—for unless a fugue is played slowly the entrance of
the subject will not be distinctly and clearly heard and the
piece will be ineffective. As soon as I find time and opportunity
I shall write five more."</p>

the thing drop. I hope, however, to force it through in time. Ah,

<h3 id="id00150" style="margin-top: 3em">CONCERNING THE OPERA</h3>

<p id="id00151" style="margin-top: 3em">When he was twenty-two years old Mozart wrote to his father,
"I am strongly filled with the desire to write an opera." Often
does he speak of this ambition. It was, in fact, his true and
individual field as the symphony was that of Beethoven. He took
counsel with his father by letter touching many details in his
earlier operas, wherefore we are advised about their origin, and,
what is more to the purpose, about Mozart's fine aesthetic
judgment. His four operatic masterpieces are imperishable, and a
few words about them are in place, particularly since Mozart has
left numerous and interesting comments on "Die Entfuhrung aus dem
Serail." This first German opera he composed with the confessed
purpose of substituting a work designed for the "national lyric
stage" for the conventional and customary Italian opera. Despite
its Hispano-Turkish color, the work is so ingenuous, so German in
feeling, and above all so full of German humor that the success
was unexampled, and Mozart could write to his father: "The people
are daft over my opera." Here, at the very outset, Mozart's
humor, the golden one of all the gifts with which Mother Nature
had endowed him, was called into play. With this work German
comic opera took its beginning. As has been remarked "although it
has been imitated, it has never been surpassed in its musically
comic effects." The delightfully Falstaffian figure of Osmin,
most ingeniously characterized in the music, will create
merriment for all time, and the opera acquires a new, personal
and peculiarly amiable charm from the fact that we are privileged
to see in the love-joy of "Belmont" and "Constanze" an image of
that of the young composer and his "Stanzerl."</p>

<p id="id00152">After "Die Entfuhrung" (1782) came "Le Nozze di Figaro" (1786),
"Don Giovanni" (1787), and "Die Zauberflote" (1791). It would be
a vain task to attempt to establish any internal relationship
between these works. Mozart was not like Wagner, a strong
personality capable of devoting a full sum of vital force to the
carrying out of a chosen and approved principle. As is generally
the case with geniuses, he was a child; a child led by momentary
conditions; moreover, a child of the rococo period. There is,
therefore, no cause of wonderment in the fact that Italian texts
are again used in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and "Don Giovanni," and
that another, but this time a complete German opera, does not
appear until we reach "Die Zauberflote."</p>

<p id="id00153">Nevertheless it is possible to note a development towards a
climax in the four operas respecting Mozart's conception of the
world. It has been denied that there is a single red thread in
Mozart's life-work. Nevertheless our method of study will
disclose to us an ever-growing view of human lift, and a deeper
and deeper glimpse into the emotional and intellectual life of
man, his aims and destiny. From the almost commonplace conditions
of "Die Entfuhrung," where a rascal sings in the best of humor
of first beheading and then hanging a man, we reach a plane in
"The Marriage of Figaro," in which despite the refinement and
mitigation of Beaumarchais's indictment we feel the revolutionary
breeze freshly blowing. In "Don Giovanni" we see the individual
set up in opposition to God and the world, in order that he
fulfill his destiny, or live out his life, as the popular phrase
goes today. Here the tremendous tragedy which lies in the story
has received a musical expression quite without parallel,
notwithstanding the moderation exercised in the employment of
means. In "Die Zauberflote," finally, we observe the
clarification which follows the fermentation. Here we breathe the
pure, clear atmosphere of heaven, the atmosphere within which he
can live who has freed himself from selfish desire, thus gaining
internal peace, and who recognizes his ego only in the happiness
and welfare of others.</p>

<p id="id00154" style="margin-top: 3em">22. "I have an unspeakable desire to compose another opera….In
Italy one can acquire more honor and credit with an opera than
with a hundred concerts in Germany, and I am the happier because
I can compose, which, after all, is my one joy and passion….I
am beside myself as soon as I hear anybody talk about an opera,
sit in a theatre or hear singing."</p>

<p id="id00155">(Munich, October 11, 1777, to his father, reporting an
expectation of making a position for himself in Italy.)</p>

<p id="id00156">23. "I beg of you do your best that we may go to Italy. You know
my greatest longing—to write operas….Do not forget my wish to
write operas! I am envious of every man who composes one; I could
almost weep from chagrin whenever I hear or see an aria. But
Italian, not German; seria not buffa."</p>

<p id="id00157">(Mannheim, February 2, 1778, to his father. Mozart wanted to go
with the Weber family (he was in love with Aloysia, his future
sister-in-law) to Italy while his father was desirous that he
should go to Paris.)</p>

<p id="id00158">24. "I am strongly possessed by the desire to write an opera—
French rather than German, but Italian rather than either German
or French. Wendling's associates are all of the opinion that my
compositions would please extraordinarily in Paris. One thing is
certain; I would not fear the test. As you know I am able to
assimilate and imitate pretty much all styles of composition."</p>

<p id="id00159">(Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father. Wendling was a
flautist in Mannheim.)</p>

<p id="id00160">25. "I assure you that if I get a commission to compose an opera
I shall not be frightened. True the (French) language is of the
devil's own making, and I fully appreciate all the difficulties
that composers have encountered; but I feel myself as capable of
overcoming them as any other composer. Au contraire when I
convince myself that all is well with my opera, I feel as if my
body were afire—my hands and feet tremble with desire to make
the Frenchman value and fear the German. Why is no Frenchman ever
commissioned to write a grand opera? Why must it always be a
foreigner? In my case the most unendurable thing would be the
singers. Well, I'm ready. I shall begin no dickerings, but if I
am challenged I shall know how to defend myself. But I should
prefer to get along without a duel; I do not like to fight with
dwarfs."</p>

<p id="id00161">(Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00162">26. "Do you imagine that I would write an opera comique in the
same manner as an opera seria? There must be as little learning
and seriousness in an opera buffa as there must be much of these
elements in an opera seria; but all the more of playfulness and
merriment. I am not responsible for the fact that there is a
desire also to hear comic music in an opera seria; the difference
is sharply drawn here. I find that the buffoon has not been
banished from music, and in this respect the French are right."</p>

<p id="id00163">(Vienna, June 16, 1781, to his father. Mozart draws the line of
demarcation sharply between tragedy and comedy in opera.
["Shakespeare has taught us to accept an infusion of the comic
element in plays of a serious cast; but Shakespeare was an
innovator, a Romanticist, and, measured by old standards, his
dramas are irregular. The Italians, who followed classic models,
for a reason amply explained by the genesis of the art-form,
rigorously excluded comedy from serious operas, except as
intermezzi, until they hit upon a third classification, which
they called opera semiseria, in which a serious subject was
enlivened with comic episodes. Our dramatic tastes being grounded
in Shakespeare, we should be inclined to put down 'Don Giovanni'
as a musical tragedy; or, haunted by the Italian terminology, as
opera semiseria; but Mozart calls it opera buffa, more in
deference to the librettist's work, I fancy, than his own."—"How
to Listen to Music," page 221. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00164">27. "In opera, willy-nilly, poetry must be the obedient daughter
of music. Why do Italian operas please everywhere, even in Paris,
as I have been a witness, despite the wretchedness of their
librettos? Because in them music rules and compels us to forget
everything else. All the more must an opera please in which the
plot is well carried out, and the words are written simply for
the sake of the music and not here and there to please some
miserable rhyme, which, God knows, adds nothing to a theatrical
representation but more often harms it. Verses are the most
indispensable thing in music, but rhymes, for the sake of rhymes,
the most injurious. Those who go to work so pedantically will
assuredly come to grief along with the music. It were best if a
good composer, who understands the stage, and is himself able to
suggest something, and a clever poet could be united in one, like
a phoenix. Again, one must not fear the applause of the
unknowing."</p>

<p id="id00165">(Vienna, October 13, 1781, to his father. The utterance is
notable as showing Mozart's belief touching the relationship
between text and music; he places himself in opposition to Gluck
whose ideas were at a later day accepted by Wagner. ["It was my
intention to confine music to its true dramatic province, of
assisting poetical expression, and of augmenting the interest of
the fable, without interrupting the action, or chilling it with
useless and superfluous ornaments; for the office of music, when
joined to poetry, seemed to me to resemble that of coloring in a
correct and well disposed design, where the lights and shades
only seem to animate the figures without altering the outline."
Gluck in his dedication of "Alceste" to the Grand Duke of
Tuscany. "The error in the genre of opera consists herein, that a
means of expression (music) has been made the end, while the end
of expression (the drama) has been made a means." Wagner, "Opera
and Drama." H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00166">28. "Nota bene, what has always seemed unnatural in an aria are

<p id="id00167">(Munich, November 8, 1780, to his father. Mozart had been invited
to Munich to compose an opera, "Idomeneo, Re di Creta," for the
carnival of 1781. [In contradistinction to the observations
touching poetry and music in the preceding paragraph, this remark
shows that he nevertheless had a sense of dramatic propriety. He

<p id="id00168">29. "The second duet will be cut out entirely—more for the good
than the harm of the opera. You shall see for yourself, if you
read over the scene, that it would be weakened and cooled by an
aria or duet, which, moreover, would be extremely annoying to the
other actors who would have to stand around with nothing to do;
besides the magnanimous contest between 'Ilia' and 'Idamante'
would become too long and therefore lose in value."</p>

<p id="id00170">30. "It will be better to write a recitative under which the
instruments can do some good work; for in this scene, which is to
be the best in the whole opera, there will be so much noise and
confusion on the stage that an aria would cut but a sorry figure.
Moreover there will be a thunder-storm which is not likely to
cease out of respect for an aria, and the effect of a recitative
between two choruses will be incomparably better."</p>

is too long? Think it over, carefully. Imagine the scene on the

must believe it real. How can this be so if the speech is too
long—the length itself convincing the listener of the
fictitiousness of the scene? If the speech of the 'Ghost' in
'Hamlet' were not so long it would be more effective."</p>

<p id="id00173">(Vienna, November 29, 1780, to his father, who had made the
following suggestions respecting the opera "Idomeneo." "Idamante
and Ilia have a short quarrel (near the close of the opera) in a
few words of recitative which is interrupted by a subterranean
noise, whereupon the oracle speaks also from the depths. The
voice and the accompaniment must be moving, terrifying and most
extraordinary; it ought to make a masterpiece of harmony.")</p>

I should prefer to have it so."</p>

<p id="id00175">(Munich, December 5, 1780, to his father. "Idomeneo" is still the
subject of discussion.)</p>

<p id="id00176">33. "As to the matter of popularity, be unconcerned; there is
music in my opera for all sorts of persons—but none for long
ears."</p>

<p id="id00177">(Munich, December 16, 1780, to his father, who had expressed a
fear that Mozart would not write down to the level of his public.
[On December 11, his father had written: "I recommend you not to
think in your work only of the musical public, but also of the
unmusical. You know that there are a hundred ignorant people for
every ten true connoisseurs; so do not forget what is called
popular and tickle the long ears." H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00178">34. "I have had a good deal of trouble with him about the
quartet. The oftener I fancy it performed on the stage the more
effective it seems to me; and it has pleased all who have heard
it on the pianoforte. Raaff alone thinks it will make no effect.
He said to me in private: 'Non c'e da spianar la voce—it is too
curt.' As if we should not speak more than we sing in a quartet!
He has no understanding of such things. I said to him simply:
'My dear friend, if I knew a single note which might be changed
in this quartet I would change it at once; but I have not been
so completely satisfied with anything in the opera as I am with
this quartet; when you have heard it sung together you will talk
differently. I have done my best to fit you with the two arias,
will do it again with the third, and hope to succeed; but you
must let the composer have his own way in trios and quartets.'
Whereupon he was satisfied. Recently he was vexed because of one
of the words in his best aria—'rinvigorir' and 'ringiovenir,'
particularly 'vienmi a rinvigorir'—five i's. It is true it
is very unpleasant at the conclusion of an aria."</p>

<p id="id00179">(Munich, December 27, 1780, to his father. Raaff was the
principal singer in the opera "Idomeneo," which Mozart had been
commissioned to write by the Elector for Munich. The observation
shows how capable Mozart was of appreciating foreign criticism.)</p>

<p id="id00180">35. "My head and hands are so full of the third act that it would
not be strange if I were myself transformed into a third act. It
has cost me more care than an entire opera, for there is scarcely
a scene in it which is not interesting. The accompaniment for the
subterranean voice consists of five voices only—three trombones
and two French-horns, which are placed at the point from which
the voice proceeds. At this moment the whole orchestra is
silent."</p>

<p id="id00181">(Munich, January 3, 1781, to his father, whom in the same letter
he invites to Munich to hear the opera.)</p>

<p id="id00182">36. "After the chorus of mourning the King, the populace,
everybody, leave the stage, and the next scene begins with the
directions: 'Idomeneo in ginochione nel tempio (Idomeneus,
kneeling in the temple).' That will never do; he must come with
all his following. That necessitates a march, and I have composed
a very simple one for two violins, viola, bass and two oboes,
which is to be played a mezza voce, during which the King enters
and the priests make the preparations for the sacrifice. Then the
King sinks on his knees and begins his prayer. In Electra's
recitative, after the subterranean voice, the word 'Partono (they
go)' should be written in; I forgot to look at the copy made for
the printer and do not know whether or how the direction has been
written in. It seems silly to me that everybody should hurry away
only in order to leave Mademoiselle Electra alone."</p>

<p id="id00183">(Munich, January 3, 1781, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00184">37. "I am glad to compose the book. The time is short, it is
true, for it must be performed about the middle of September; but
the circumstances connected with the performances, and a number
of other purposes, are of such a character that they enliven my
spirits in such a degree that I hurry to my writing desk and
remain seated there with great joy."</p>

<p id="id00185">(Vienna, August 1, 1781, to his father. The opera referred to is
"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail." The "circumstances" were the
court festivals which were to celebrate the coming of the Russian
Grand Duke, from which Mozart, as was his wont, expected all
manner of future benefits.)</p>

<p id="id00186">38. "As regards the work of Stephanie you are right, of course,
but nevertheless the poetry is well fitted to the character of
the stupid, coarse and malicious Osmin. I know full well that the
style of the verse is none of the best, but it has so adjusted
itself to the musical thoughts (which were promenading in my
brain in advance) that the lines had to please me, and I will
wager there will be no disappointment at the performance. So far
as the songs are concerned they are not to be despised. Belmont's
aria 'O, wie angstlich' could scarcely have been written better
for music."</p>

<p id="id00187">(Vienna, October 13, 1781, to his father. Stephanie was the
author of the libretto of "Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.")</p>

<p id="id00188">39. "An aria has been written for Osmin in the first act….You
have seen only the beginning and end of it, which must be
effective; the rage of Osmin is made ridiculous by the use of
Turkish music. In developing the aria I have given him (Fischer,
a bass) a chance to show his beautiful low tones. The 'By the
beard of the Prophet' remains in the same tempo but has quicker
notes, and as his anger grows continually, when one thinks that
the aria is come to an end, the Allegro assai must make the best
kind of an effect when it enters in a different measure and key.
Here is the reason: a man who is in such a violent rage oversteps
all order, all moderation; he forgets himself, and the music must
do the same.</p>

<p id="id00189">"Inasmuch as the passions, whether violent or not, must never be
carried in their expression to the verge of disgust, and music,
even in the most awful situations must not offend the ear but
always please, consequently always remain music, I have not
chosen a key foreign to F (i.e. the key of the aria), but a
related one,—not the nearest, D minor, but the more distant, A
minor. You know how I have given expression to Belmont's aria,
'O, wie angstlich, O wie feurig,'—there is a suggestion of the
beating heart,—the violins in octaves. This is the favorite aria
of all who have heard it,—of myself, as well,—and is written
right into the voice of Adamberger. One can see the reeling and
trembling, one can see the heaving breast which is illustrated by
a crescendo; one hears the lispings and sighs expressed by the
muted violins with flute in unison. The Janizary chorus is, as
such, all that could be asked, short and jolly, written to suit
the Viennese."</p>

<p id="id00190">(Vienna, September 26, 1781, to his father. Concerning the
composition of "Die Entfuhrung," Mozart delivered himself at
greater length and more explicitly than about any other opera.
From the above excerpt one can learn his notions touching musical
characterization and delineation. ["Turkish" music, or "Janizary"
music, is that in which the percussion effects of Oriental music
are imitated—music utilizing the large drum, cymbals, etc.
H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00191">40. "The close will make a deal of noise; and that is all that
is necessary for the end of an act;—the noisier the better, the
shorter the better, so that the people shall not get too cool to
applaud."</p>

<p id="id00192">(Vienna, September 26, 1781, to his father. The Trio at the end
of the first act is the finale referred to.)</p>

<p id="id00193">41. "My opera is to be performed again next Friday, but I have
protested against it as I do not want it to be ridden to death at
once. The public, I may say, are daft about this opera. It does a
fellow good to receive such applause."</p>

<p id="id00194">(Vienna, July 27, 1782, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00195">42. "My opera was performed again yesterday, this time at the
request of Gluck. Gluck paid me many compliments on it. I am to
dine with him tomorrow."</p>

<p id="id00196">(Vienna, August 7, 1782, to his father. [How Mozart and Gluck
differed in principle on the relation between text and music the
reader has already had an opportunity to learn. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00197">43. "The most necessary thing is that the whole be really
comical; then, if possible, there should be two equally good
female parts, one seria, the other mezzo carattere; but one must
be as good as the other. The third woman may be all buffa, also
all the men if necessary."</p>

<p id="id00198">(Vienna, May 7, 1783, to his father, in Salzburg, where the Abbe<br/>

Varesco was to write an opera libretto.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00199">44. "It would be a pity if I should have composed this music for
nothing, that is to say if no regard is to be shown for things
that are absolutely essential. Neither you, nor Abbe Varesco, nor
I, reflected that it will be a bad thing, that the opera will be
a failure, in fact, if neither of the principal women appears on
the scene until the last minute, but both are kept promenading on
the bastion of the fortress. I credit the audience with patience
enough for one act, but it would never endure the second. It must
not be."</p>

<p id="id00200">(Vienna, December 6, 1783, to his father. The opera in question,
entitled "L'Oca del Cairo," was never finished.)</p>

<p id="id00201">45. "Abbe Varesco has written over the cavatina for Lavina:
a cui servira la musica della cavatina antecedente,—that is
the cavatina of Celidora. But that will never do. In Celidora's
cavatina the words are comfortless and hopeless, while in
Lavina's cavatina they are full of comfort and hope. Moreover it
is hackneyed and no longer customary habit to let one singer echo
the song of another. At best it might only be done by a soubrette
and her sweetheart at ultime parti."</p>

<p id="id00202">(Vienna, December 24, 1783, to his father. The Italian phrase is
a direction that the music of a preceding cavatina might be used
for a second cavatina.)</p>

<p id="id00203">46. "It is much more natural, since they have all come to an
agreement in the quartetto to carry out their plan of attack that
the men leave the stage to gather their helpers together, and the
women quietly retire to their retreat. All that can be allowed
them is a few lines of recitative."</p>

<p id="id00204">(Vienna, December 24, 1783, to his father. The situation referred
to was in Varesco's opera which never reached completion.)</p>

<p id="id00205">47. "At six o'clock I drove with Count Canal to the so-called
'Breitfeldischen Ball' where the pick of the beauties of Prague
are in the habit of congregating. That would have been something
for you, my friend! I fancy seeing you,—not walking, but
limping,—after all the pretty girls and women! I did not dance,
neither did I spoon;—the first because I was too tired, the
second because of my congenital bashfulness. But I saw with great
pleasure how all these people hopped about delightedly to the
music of my 'Figaro' turned into contradances and Allemands.
Here nothing is talked about except 'Figaro,' nothing played,
piped, sung or whistled except 'Figaro;' no opera is attended
except 'Figaro,' always 'Figaro.' Certainly a great honor for
me."</p>

<p id="id00206">(Prague, January 15, 1787, to a friend, whose name is unknown.)</p>

<p id="id00207">48. "'Don Giovanni' was not written for the Viennese; rather for
the people of Prague, but most of all for me and my friends."</p>

<p id="id00208">(Reported by Nissen, who also relates that Mozart often said
"The Bohemians are the ones who understand me." When "Le Nozze
di Figaro" received an enthusiastic reception in Prague, Mozart
said: "Because the Bohemians understand me so well I must write
an opera for them." The opera was "Don Giovanni.")</p>

<p id="id00209">49. "I am just home from the opera; it was as crowded as ever.
The duet, 'Mann und Weib,' and the bells in the first act, were
repeated as usual,—also the trio of the boys in the second act.
But what delights me most is the silent applause! It is easy to
see how this opera is ever rising."</p>

<p id="id00210">(Vienna, October 7, 1791, to his wife. The opera was "Die<br/>

Zauberflote.")<br/>

<h3 id="id00211" style="margin-top: 3em">MUSICAL PEDAGOGICS</h3>

<p id="id00212" style="margin-top: 3em">50. "Herr Stein is completely daft on the subject of his
daughter. She is eight years old and learns everything by heart.
Something may come of her for she has talent, but not if she goes
on as she is doing now; she will never acquire velocity because
she purposely makes her hand heavy. She will never learn the most
necessary, most difficult and principal thing in music, that is
time, because from childhood she has designedly cultivated the
habit of ignoring the beat."</p>

<p id="id00213">(Augsburg, October 23, 1777, to his father. Nanette Stein
afterward married Andreas Streicher, who was Schiller's companion
in his flight to Franconia. As Frau Streicher she became
Beethoven's faithful friend and frequently took it upon herself
to straighten out his domestic affairs.)</p>

<p id="id00214">51. "If she does not get some thoughts and ideas (for now she has
absolutely none), it will all be in vain, for God knows, I can
not give her any. It is not her father's intention to make a
great composer out of her. 'She shall,' he says, 'not write any
operas, or arias, or symphonies, but only great sonatas for her
instrument and mine!' I gave her her fourth lesson today, and so
far as the rules of composition and her exercises are concerned I
am pretty well satisfied with her. She wrote a very good bass to
the first minuet which I set her, and has already begun to write
in three parts. It goes, but she gets bored too quickly. I can
not help her; progress is impossible, she is too young even if
she had talent. Unfortunately she has none; she must be taught
artificially; she has no ideas, there are no results, I have
tried in every sort of way. Among other things it occurred to me
to write down a very simple minuet and to see if she could write
a variation on it. In vain. Well, thought I, it is because she
does not know how to begin. I then began a variation of the first
measure and told her to continue it in the same manner; that went
fairly well. When she had made an end I asked her to begin
something of her own,—only the first voice, a melody. She
thought a full quarter of an hour, and nothing came. Thereupon I
wrote four measures of a minuet and said to her: 'Now look what
an ass I am; I have begun a minuet and can't finish even the
first part; be good enough to finish it for me.' She thought it
impossible. At length she produced a little something to my joy.
Then I made her finish the minuet, i.e. only the first voice. For
her home work I have given her nothing to do except to alter my
four measures and make something out of them, to invent another
beginning, to keep to the harmony if she must, but to write a new
melody. We shall see what comes of it tomorrow."</p>

<p id="id00215">(Paris, May 14, 1778, to his father. The pupil was the daughter
of the Duke de Guines, an excellent flautist. "She plays the harp
magnificently," writes Mozart in the same letter; "has a great
deal of talent and genius, and an incomparable memory. She knows
200 pieces and plays them all by heart." When it came to paying
Mozart for the lessons the Duke was anything but a nobleman.)</p>

<p id="id00216">52. "The Andante is going to give us the most trouble, for it is
full of expression and must be played with taste and accurately
as written in the matter of forte and piano. She is very clever
and learns quickly. The right hand is very good but the left
utterly ruined. I can say that I often pity her when I see that
she is obliged to labor till she gasps, not because she is unapt,
but because she can't help it,—she is used to playing so, nobody
ever taught her differently. I said to her mother and her that if
I were her regular teacher, I would lock up all her music, cover
the keyboard with a handkerchief, and make her practice both
hands at first slowly on nothing but passages, trills, mordents,
etc., until the difficulty with the left hand was remedied; after
that I am sure I could make a real clavier player out of her. It
is a pity; she has so much genius, reads respectably, has a great
deal of natural fluency and plays with a great deal of feeling."</p>

<p id="id00217">(Mannheim, November 16, 1777, to his father. The pupil was Rose
Cannabich, to whom the sonata referred to is dedicated. Her
father, whom Mozart admired greatly as an able conductor, was
Chapelmaster of the excellently trained orchestra at Mannheim. He
lived from 1731 to 1798. [The Andante from which trouble was
expected was that which Mozart wrote with the purpose that it
should reflect the character of Rose Cannabich, a lovely and
amiable girl, according to all accounts. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00218">53. "This E is very forced. One can see that it was written only
to go from one consonance to another in parallel motion,—just as
bad poets write nonsense for the sake of a rhyme."</p>

<p id="id00219">(From the exercise book of the cousin of Abbe Stadler who took
lessons in thorough-bass from Mozart in 1784. It is preserved in
the Court Library in Vienna.)</p>

<p id="id00220">54. "My good lad, you ask my advice and I will give it you
candidly; had you studied composition when you were at Naples,
and when your mind was not devoted to other pursuits, you would,
perhaps, have done wisely; but now that your profession of the
stage must, and ought to, occupy all your attention, it would be
an unwise measure to enter into a dry study. You may take my word
for it, Nature has made you a melodist, and you would only
disturb and perplex yourself. Reflect, 'a little knowledge is a
dangerous thing;'—should there be errors in what you write, you
will find hundreds of musicians in all parts of the world capable
of correcting them, therefore do not disturb your natural gift."</p>

<p id="id00221">(To Michael Kelly, the Irish tenor, to whom Mozart assigned the
parts of Basilio and Don Curzio at the first performance of "Le
Nozze di Figaro" in 1786. Kelly had asked Mozart whether or not
he should study counterpoint. [See No. 8. Three years later Kelly
returned to England, began his career as composer of musical
pieces for the stage. He was fairly prolific, but failed to
impress the public with the originality of his creative talent.
He went into the wine business, which fact led Sheridan to make
the witty suggestion that he inscribe over his shop: "Michael
Kelly, Composer of Wines and Importer of Music." He was born in
1764 and died in 1826. H.E.K.])</p>
