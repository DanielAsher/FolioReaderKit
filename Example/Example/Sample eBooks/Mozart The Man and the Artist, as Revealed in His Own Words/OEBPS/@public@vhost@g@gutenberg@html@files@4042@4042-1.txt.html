rod or feel the teacher's tongue when boys, and later think that
they can compel things to their wishes by mere talent and
inclination. Many succeed fairly well, but with other people's
ideas, having none of their own; others who have ideas of their
own, do not know what to do with them. That is your case."</p>

symphony.)</p>

most of the musicians were old men. There would have been no end
of dragging if I had not first driven them into the fire and made
them angry. Out of pure rage they did their best."</p>

<p id="id00225">(Reported by Rochlitz. Mozart was rehearsing the Allegro of one
of his symphonies in Leipsic. He worked up such a fit of anger
that he stamped his foot and broke one of his shoe-laces. His
anger fled and he broke into a merry laugh.)</p>

<p id="id00226">57. "Right! That's the way to shriek."</p>

<p id="id00227">(At a rehearsal of "Don Giovanni" the representative of Zerlina
did not act realistically enough to suit Mozart. Thereupon he
went unnoticed on the stage and at the repetition of the scene
grabbed the singer so rudely and unexpectedly that she
involuntarily uttered the shriek which the scene called for. [The
singer was Teresa Bondini, the place Prague, and the time before
the first performance of the opera which took place on October
29, 1787. H.E.K.])</p>

<h3 id="id00228" style="margin-top: 3em">TOUCHING MUSICAL PERFORMANCES</h3>

<p id="id00229" style="margin-top: 3em">58. "Herr Stein sees and hears that I am more of a player than
Beecke,—that without making grimaces of any kind I play so
expressively that, according to his own confession, no one shows
off his pianoforte as well as I. That I always remain strictly in
time surprises every one; they can not understand that the left
hand should not in the least be concerned in a tempo rubato. When
they play the left hand always follows."</p>

<p id="id00230">(Augsburg, October 23, 1777, to his father. [We have here a
suggestion of the tempo rubato as played by Chopin according to
the testimony of Mikuli, who said that no matter how free Chopin
was either in melody or arabesque with his right hand, the left
always adhered strictly to the time. Mozart learned the principle
from his father who in his method for the violin condemned the
accompanists who spoiled the tempo rubato of an artist by waiting
to follow him. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00231">59. "Whoever can see and hear her (the daughter of Stein) play
without laughing must be a stone (Stein) like her father. She
sits opposite the treble instead of in the middle of the
instrument, so that there may be greater opportunities for
swaying about and making grimaces. Then she rolls up her eyes and
smirks. If a passage occurs twice it is played slower the second
time; if three times, still slower. When a passage comes up goes
the arm, and if there is to be an emphasis it must come from the
arm, heavily and clumsily, not from the fingers. But the best of
all is that when there comes a passage (which ought to flow like
oil) in which there necessarily occurs a change of fingers, there
is no need of taking care; when the time comes you stop, lift the
hand and nonchalantly begin again. This helps one the better to
catch a false note, and the effect is frequently curious."</p>

<p id="id00232">(Augsburg, October 23, 1777. The letter is to his father and the
young woman whose playing is criticized is the little miss of
eight years, Nanette Stein.)</p>

<p id="id00233">60. "When I told Herr Stein that I would like to play on his
organ and that I was passionately fond of the instrument, he
marveled greatly and said: 'What, a man like you, so great a
clavier player, want to play on an instrument which has no
douceur, no expression, neither piano nor forte, but goes on
always the same?' 'But all that signifies nothing; to me the
organ is nevertheless the king of instruments.' "</p>

<p id="id00234">(Augsburg, October 17, 1777, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00235">61. "I had the pleasure to hear Herr Franzl (whose wife is a
sister of Madame Cannabich) play a concerto on the violin. He
pleases me greatly. You know that I am no great lover of
difficulties. He plays difficult things, but one does not
recognize that they are difficult, but imagines that one could do
the same thing at once; that is true art. He also has a
beautiful, round tone,—not a note is missing, one hears
everything; everything is well marked. He has a fine staccato
bow, up as well as down; and I have never heard so good a double
shake as his. In a word, though he is no wizard he is a solid
violinist."</p>

play in the proper tempo; give expression to every note,
appoggiatura, etc., tastefully and as they are written, so as to
create the impression that the player had composed the piece."</p>

sharply criticizing the playing of Abbe Vogler. [See No. 66.])</p>

she lacks the true singing style in the cantabile; she is too
jerky."</p>

<p id="id00240">(Vienna, June 27, 1781, to his father. Beethoven found the same
fault with Mozart's playing that Mozart here condemns.)</p>

<p id="id00241">64. "Herr Richter plays much and well so far as execution is
concerned, but—as you will hear—crudely, laboriously and
without taste or feeling; he is one of the best fellows in the
world, and without a particle of vanity. Whenever I played for
him he looked immovably at my fingers, and one day he said 'My
God! how I am obliged to torment myself and sweat, and yet
without obtaining applause; and for you, my friend, it is mere
play!' 'Yes,' said I, 'I had to labor once in order not to show
labor now.' "</p>

pianist Richter, whom he recommends to his father, is going on a
concert trip.)</p>

<p id="id00243">65. "Meissner, as you know, has the bad habit of purposely making
his voice tremble, marking thus entire quarter and eighth notes;
I never could endure it in him. It is indeed despicable and
contrary to all naturalness in song. True the human voice
trembles of itself, but only in a degree that remains beautiful;
it is in the nature of the voice. We imitate it not only on wind
instruments but also on the viols and even on the clavier. But as
soon as you overstep the limit it is no longer beautiful because
it is contrary to nature."</p>

<p id="id00244">(Paris, June 12, 1778, to his father. [The statement that the
tremolo effect could be imitated on the clavier seems to require
an explanation. Mozart obviously had in view, not the pianoforte
which was just coming into use in his day, but the clavichord.
This instrument was sounded by striking the strings with bits of
brass placed in the farther end of the keys which were simple and
direct levers. The tangents, as they were called, had to be held
against the strings as long as it was desired that the tone
should sound, and by gently repeating the pressure on the key a
tremulousness was imparted to the tone which made the clavichord
a more expressive instrument than the harpsichord or the early
pianoforte. The effect was called Bebung in German, and
Balancement in French. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00245">66. "Before dinner Herr Vogler dashed through my sonata prima
vista. He played the first movement prestissimo, the andante
allegro and the rondo prestissimo with a vengeance. As a rule,
he played a different bass than the one I had written, and
occasionally he changed the harmony as well as the melody. That
was inevitable, for at such speed the eyes can not follow, nor
the hands grasp, the music. Such playing at sight and…are all
one to me. The hearers (I mean those worthy of the name) can say
nothing more than they have seen music and clavier playing. You
can imagine that it was all the more unendurable because I did
not dare to say to him: 'Much too quick!' Moreover it is much
easier to play rapidly than slowly; you can drop a few notes in
passages without any one noticing it. But is it beautiful? At
such speed you can use the hands indiscriminately; but is that
beautiful?"</p>

<p id="id00246">(Mannheim, January 17, 1778, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00247">67. "They hurry the tempo, trill or pile on the adornments
because they can neither study nor sustain a tone."</p>

<p id="id00248">(Recorded by Rochlitz as a criticism by Mozart of Italian singers
in 1789.)</p>

<p id="id00249">68. "It is thus, they think, that they can infuse warmth and
ardor into their singing. Ah, if there is no fire in the
composition you will surely never get it in by hurrying it."</p>

<p id="id00250">(According to Rochlitz Mozart used these words while complaining
of the manner in which his compositions were ruined by
exaggerated speed in the tempi.)</p>

<p id="id00252" style="margin-top: 3em">69. "We wish that it were in our power to introduce the German
taste in minuets in Italy; minuets here last almost as long as
whole symphonies."</p>

<p id="id00253">(Bologna, September 22, 1770, to his mother and sister. Mozart as
a lad was making a tour through Italy with his father. [There
might be a valuable hint here touching the proper tempo for the
minuets in Mozart's symphonies. Of late years the conductors, of
the Wagnerian school more particularly, have acted on the belief
that the symphonic minuets of Mozart and Haydn must be played
with the stately slowness of the old dance. Mozart himself was
plainly of another opinion. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00254">70. "Beecke told me (and it is true) that music is now played in
the cabinet of the Emperor (Joseph II) bad enough to set the dogs
a-running. I remarked that unless I quickly escape such music I
get a headache. 'It doesn't hurt me in the least; bad music
leaves my nerves unaffected, but I sometimes get a headache from
good music.' Then I thought to myself: Yes, such a shallow-pate
as you feels a pain as soon as he hears something which he can
not understand."</p>

<p id="id00255">(Mannheim, November 13, 1777, to his father. Beecke was a
conceited pianist.)</p>

<p id="id00256">71. "Nothing gives me so much pleasure in the anticipation as the
Concert spirituel in Paris, for I fancy I shall be called on to
compose something. The orchestra is said to be large and good,
and my principal favorites can be well performed there, that is
to say choruses, and I am right glad that the Frenchmen are fond
of them….Heretofore Paris has been used to the choruses of
Gluck. Depend on me; I shall labor with all my powers to do honor
to the name of Mozart."</p>

<p id="id00257">(Mannheim. February 28, 1778, to his father. On March 7 he
writes: "I have centered all my hopes on Paris, for the German
princes are all niggards.")</p>

<p id="id00258">72. "I do not know whether or not my symphony pleases, and, to
tell you the truth, I don't much care. Whom should it please? I
warrant it will please the few sensible Frenchmen who are here,
and there will be no great misfortune if it fails to please the
stupids. Still I have some hope that the asses too will find
something in it to their liking."</p>

<p id="id00259">(Paris, June 12, 1778, to his father. The symphony is that known
as the "Parisian" (Kochel, No. 297). It is characterized by
brevity and wealth of melody.)</p>

<p id="id00260">73. "The most of the symphonies are not to the local taste. If I
find time I shall revise a few violin concertos,—shorten them,—
for our taste in Germany is for long things; as a matter of fact,
short and good is better."</p>

<p id="id00261">(Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, in Salzburg.

to music! It is abominable; German is divine in comparison. And

not sing; they shriek, they howl with all their might, through
throat, nose and gullet."</p>

writing a French opera.)</p>

<p id="id00264">75. "Ah, if we too had clarinets! You can't conceive what a
wonderful effect a symphony with flutes, oboes and clarinets
makes. At the first audience with the Archbishop I shall have
much to tell him, and, probably, a few suggestions to make. Alas!
our music might be much better and more beautiful if only the
Archbishop were willing."</p>

<p id="id00265">(Mannheim, December 3, 1778, to his father. Mozart was on his
return to Salzburg where he had received an appointment in the
Archiepiscopal chapel. It seems that wood-wind instruments were
still absent from the symphony orchestra in Salzburg.)</p>

<p id="id00266">76. "Others know as well as you and I that tastes are continually
changing, and that the changes extend even into church music;
this should not be, but it accounts for the fact that true church
music is now found only in the attic and almost eaten up by the
worms."</p>

<p id="id00267">(Vienna, April 12, 1783, to his father, who was active as Court
Chapelmaster in Salzburg, and who had been asked by his son in
the same letter, when it grew a little warmer, "to look in the
attic and send some of your (his) church music.")</p>

<p id="id00268">77. "The themes pleased me most in the symphony; yet it will
be the least effective, for there is too much in it, and a
fragmentary performance of it sounds like an ant hill looks,—

<p id="id00269">(In a letter written in 1789 to a nobleman who was a composer and
had submitted a symphony to Mozart for criticism.)</p>

<p id="id00270">78. "So far as melody is concerned, yes; for dramatic effect, no.<br/>

Moreover the scores which you may see here, outside those of<br/>

Gretry, are by Gluck, Piccini and Salieri, and there is nothing<br/>

French about them except the words."<br/>

<p id="id00271">(A remark made to Joseph Frank, whom Mozart frequently found
occupied with French scores, and who had asked whether the study
of Italian scores were not preferable.)</p>

<p id="id00272">79. "The ode is elevated, beautiful, everything you wish, but too
exaggerated and bombastic for my ears. But what would you? The
golden mean, the truth, is no longer recognized or valued. To win
applause one must write stuff so simple that a coachman might
sing it after you, or so incomprehensible that it pleases simply
because no sensible man can comprehend it. But it is not this
that I wanted to discuss with you, but another matter. I have a
strong desire to write a book, a little work on musical criticism
with illustrative examples. N.B., not under my name."</p>

<p id="id00273">(Vienna, December 28, 1782, to his father. "I was working on a
very difficult task—a Bardic song by Denis on Gibraltar. It is a
secret, for a Hungarian lady wants thus to honor Denis." When
Gibraltar was gallantly defended against the Spaniards, Mozart's
father wrote to him calling his attention to the victory. Mozart
replied: "Yes, I have heard of England's triumph, and, indeed,
with great joy (for you know well that I am an arch-Englishman)."
The little book of criticism never appeared.)</p>

<p id="id00274">80. "The orchestra in Berlin contains the greatest aggregation of
virtuosi in the world; I never heard such quartet playing as
here; but when all the gentlemen are together they might do
better."</p>

<p id="id00275">(To King Frederick William II, in 1789, when asked for an opinion
on the orchestra in Berlin. The king asked Mozart to transfer his
services to the Court at Berlin; Mozart replied: "Shall I forsake
my good Emperor?")</p>

<h3 id="id00276" style="margin-top: 3em">OPINIONS CONCERNING OTHERS</h3>

<p id="id00277" style="margin-top: 3em">81. "Holzbauer's music is very beautiful; the poetry is not
worthy of it. What amazes me most is that so old a man as
Holzbauer should have so much spirit,—it is incredible, the
amount of fire in his music."</p>

<p id="id00278">(Mannheim, November 14, 1777, to his father. Ignaz Holzbauer was
born in Vienna, in 1711, and died as chapelmaster in Mannheim, on
April 7, 1793. During the last years of his life he was totally
deaf. The music referred to was the setting of the first great
German Singspiel, "Gunther von Schwarzburg.")</p>

<p id="id00279">82. "There is much that is pretty in many of Martini's things,
but in ten years nobody will notice them."</p>

<p id="id00280">(Reported by Nissen. Martini lived in Bologna from 1706 to 1784;
there Mozart learned to know and admire him. In 1776 he wrote a
letter to him in which he said that of all people in the world he
"loved, honored and valued" him most.)</p>

<p id="id00281">83. "For those who seek only light entertainment in music nobody
better can be recommended than Paisiello."</p>

<p id="id00282">(Reported by Nissen. Paisiello was born in Taranto in 1741,
composed over a hundred operas which, like his church music, won
much applause. He died in Naples in 1816. Mozart considered his
music "transparent.")</p>

<p id="id00283">84. "Jomelli has his genre in which he shines, and we must
abandon the thought of supplanting him in that field in the
judgment of the knowing. But he ought not to have abandoned his
field to compose church music in the old style, for instance."</p>

<p id="id00284">(Reported by Nissen. Jomelli was born in 1714 near Naples, where
he died in 1774. He was greatly admired as a composer of operas
and church music. He was Court Chapelmaster in Stuttgart from
1753 to 1769.)</p>

<p id="id00285">85. "Wait till you know how many of his works we have in Vienna!
When I get back home I shall diligently study his church music,
and I hope to learn a great deal from it."</p>

<p id="id00286">(A remark made in Leipsic when somebody spoke slightingly of the
music of Gassmann, an Imperial Court Chapelmaster in Vienna, and
much respected by Maria Theresa and Joseph.)</p>

<p id="id00287">86. "The fact that Gatti, the ass, begged the Archbishop for
permission to compose a serenade shows his worthiness to wear the
title, which I make no doubt he deserves also for his musical
learning."</p>

best church pieces; for we love to entertain ourselves with all
manner of masters, ancient and modern. Therefore I beg of you
send us something of yours as soon as possible."</p>

<p id="id00290">(Vienna, March 29, 1783, to his father, Leopold Mozart in<br/>

Salzburg, himself a capable composer.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00291">88. "In a sense Vogler is nothing but a wizard. As soon as he
attempts to play something majestic he becomes dry, and you are
glad that he, too, feels bored and makes a quick ending. But what
follows?—unintelligible slip-slop. I listened to him from a
distance. Afterward he began a fugue with six notes on the same
tone, and Presto! Then I went up to him. As a matter of fact I
would rather watch him than hear him."</p>

<p id="id00292">(Mannheim, December 18, 1777, to his father. Abbe Vogler was
trying the new organ in the Lutheran church at Mannheim. Vogler
lived from 1749 to 1814, and was the teacher of Karl Maria von
Weber (who esteemed him highly) and Meyerbeer. Mozart's criticism
seems unduly severe.)</p>

<p id="id00293">89. "I was at mass, a brand new composition by Vogler. I had
already been at the rehearsal day before yesterday afternoon, but
went away after the Kyrie. In all my life I have heard nothing like
this. Frequently everything is out of tune. He goes from key to key
as if he wanted to drag one along by the hair of the head, not in
an interesting manner which might be worth while, but bluntly and
rudely. As to the manner in which he develops his ideas I shall say
nothing; but this I will say that it is impossible for a mass by
Vogler to please any composer worthy of the name. Briefly, I hear a
theme which is not bad; does it long remain not bad think you? will
it not soon become beautiful? Heaven forefend! It grows worse and
worse in a two-fold or three-fold manner; for instance scarcely is
it begun before something else enters and spoils it; or he makes so
unnatural a close that it can not remain good; or it is misplaced;
or, finally, it is ruined by the orchestration. That's Vogler's
music."</p>

<p id="id00294">(Mannheim, November 20, 1777, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00295">90. "Clementi plays well so far as execution with the right hand
is concerned; his forte is passages in thirds. Aside from this he
hasn't a pennyworth of feeling or taste; in a word he is a mere
mechanician."</p>

<p id="id00296">(Vienna, January 12, 1782, to his father. Four days later Mozart
expressed the same opinion of Muzio Clementi, who is still in
good repute, after having met him in competition before the
emperor. "Clementi preluded and played a sonata; then the Emperor
said to me, 'Allons, go ahead.' I preluded and played some
variations.")</p>

<p id="id00297">91. "Now I must say a few words to my sister about the Clementi
sonatas. Every one who plays or hears them will feel for himself
that as compositions they do not signify. There are in them no
remarkable or striking passages, with the exception of those in
sixths and octaves, and I beg my sister not to devote too much
time to these lest she spoil her quiet and steady hand and make
it lose its natural lightness, suppleness and fluent rapidity.
What, after all, is the use? She is expected to play the sixths
and octaves with the greatest velocity (which no man will
accomplish, not even Clementi), and if she tries she will produce
a frightful zig-zag, and nothing more. Clementi is a Ciarlatano
like all Italians. He writes upon a sonata Presto, or even
Prestissimo and alla breve, and plays it Allegro in 4-4 time. I
know it because I have heard him! What he does well is his
passages in thirds; but he perspired over these day and night in
London. Aside from this he has nothing,—absolutely nothing; not
excellence in reading, nor taste, nor sentiment."</p>

<p id="id00298">(Vienna, June 7, 1783, to his father and sister.)</p>

<p id="id00299">92. "Handel knows better than any of us what will make an effect;
when he chooses he strikes like a thunderbolt; even if he is
often prosy, after the manner of his time, there is always
something in his music."</p>

<p id="id00300">(Mozart valued Handel most highly. He knew his masterpieces by
heart—not only the choruses but also many arias. [Reported by
Rochlitz. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00301">93. "Apropos, I intended, while asking you to send back the
rondo, to send me also the six fugues by Handel and the toccatas
and fugues by Eberlin. I go every Sunday to Baron von Swieten's,
and there nothing is played except Handel and Bach. I am making a
collection of the fugues,—those of Sebastian as well as of
Emanuel and Friedemann Bach; also of Handel's, and here the six
are lacking. Besides I want to let the baron hear those of
Eberlin. In all likelihood you know that the English Bach is
dead; a pity for the world of music."</p>

<p id="id00302">(Vienna, April 10, 1782, to his father. Johann Ernst Eberlin
(Eberle), born in 1702, died in 1762 as archiepiscopal
chapelmaster in Salzburg. Many of his unpublished works are
preserved in Berlin. The "English" Bach was Johann Christian, son
of the great Johann Sebastian. As a child Mozart made his
acquaintance in London.)</p>

<p id="id00303">94. "I shall be glad if papa has not yet had the works of Eberlin
copied, for I have gotten them meanwhile, and discovered,—for I
could not remember,—that they are too trivial and surely do not
deserve a place among those of Bach and Handel. All respect to
his four-part writing, but his clavier fugues are nothing but
long-drawn-out versetti."</p>

<p id="id00304">(Vienna, April 29, 1782, to his sister Nannerl.)</p>

<p id="id00305">95. "Johann Christian Bach has been here (Paris) for a fortnight.
He is to write a French opera, and is come only to hear the
singers, whereupon he will go to London, write the opera, and
come back to put it on the stage. You can easily imagine his
delight and mine when we met again. Perhaps his delight was not
altogether sincere, but one must admit that he is an honorable
man and does justice to all. I love him, as you know, with all my
heart, and respect him; as for him, one thing is certain, that to
my face and to others, he really praised me, not extravagantly,
like some, but seriously and in earnest."</p>

Bach was the second son of Johann Sebastian, and born in 1735.
He lived in London where little Wolfgang learned to know him in
1764. Bach took the precocious boy on his knee and the two played
on the harpsichord. [Bach was Music Master to the Queen. "He
liked to play with the boy," says Jahn; "took him upon his knee
and went through a sonata with him, each in turn playing a
measure with such precision that no one would have suspected

completed when Bach broke off." H.E.K.])</p>

chorus, "Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied," at Leipsic in 1789.

out: 'What is that?' and now his whole soul seemed to be in his
ears.")</p>

to him; for it was from him that I learned how to write
quartets."</p>

"Don Giovanni" was under discussion: "This I do know, that Mozart

some day!"</p>

<p id="id00318">(A remark made by Mozart in reference to Beethoven in the spring
of 1787. It was the only meeting between the two composers. [The

sound musician."</p>

<p id="id00320">(Remarked in 1786 to Michael Kelly, who was a friend of Attwood
and a pupil of Mozart at the time. [Thomas Attwood was an English
musician, born in 1765. He was chorister of the Chapel Royal at
the age of nine, and at sixteen attracted the attention of the
Prince of Wales, afterward George IV., who sent him to Italy to
study. He studied two years in Naples and one year in Vienna with
Mozart. Returned to London he first composed for the theatre and
afterward largely for the church. He and Mendelssohn were devoted
friends. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00321">103. "If the oboist Fischer did not play better when we heard him
in Holland (1766) than he plays now, he certainly does not
deserve the reputation which he has. Yet, between ourselves, I
was too young at the time to pronounce a judgment; I remember
that he pleased me exceedingly, and the whole world. It is
explained easily enough if one but realizes that tastes have
changed mightily since then. You would think that he plays
according to the old school; but no! he plays like a wretched
pupil….And then his concertos, his compositions! Every
ritornello lasts a quarter of an hour; then the hero appears,
lifts one leaden foot after the other and plumps them down
alternately. His tone is all nasal, and his tenuto sounds like an
organ tremulant."</p>

<p id="id00322">(Vienna, April 4, 1787, to his father. Johann Christian
Fischer—1733-1800—was a famous oboist and composer for his
instrument. [Fischer was probably the original of the many artists
of whom the story is told that, having been invited by a nobleman
to dinner, he was asked if he had brought his instrument with him,
replied that he had not, for that his instrument never ate. Kelly
tells the story in his "Reminiscences" and makes Fischer the hero.

letters with him. The lad seems to have felt ironical.)</p>

<p id="id00325">105. "Now I am also acquainted with Herr Wieland; but he doesn't
know me as well as I know him, for he has not heard anything of
mine. I never imagined him to be as he is. He seems to me to be a
little affected in speech, has a rather childish voice, a fixed
stare, a certain learned rudeness, yet, at times, a stupid
condescension. I am not surprised that he behaves as he does here
(and as he would not dare do in Weimar or elsewhere), for the
people look at him as if he had fallen direct from heaven. All
stand in awe, no one talks, everyone is silent, every word is
listened to when he speaks. It is a pity that he keeps people in
suspense so long, for he has a defect of speech which compels him
to speak very slowly and pause after every six words. Otherwise
his is, as we all know, an admirable brain. His face is very
ugly, pockmarked, and his nose rather long. He is a little taller
than papa."</p>

<p id="id00326">(Mannheim, December 27, 1777, to his father. On November 22,
Mozart had reported: "In the coming carnival 'Rosamunde' will be
performed—new poetry by Herr Wieland, new music by Herr
Schweitzer." On January 10, 1778, he writes: "'Rosamunde' was
rehearsed in the theatre today; it is—good, but nothing more. If
it were bad you could not perform it at all; just as you can't
sleep without going to bed!")</p>

<p id="id00327">106. "Now that Herr Wieland has seen me twice he is entirely

that's the case with the Archduke. Before he was a priest he was
much wittier and intelligent; spoke less but more sensibly. You
ought to see him now! Stupidity looks out of his eyes, he talks
and chatters eternally and always in falsetto. His neck is
swollen,—in short he has been completely transformed."</p>

<p id="id00332">(Vienna, November 17, 1781, to his father. The person spoken of
was Archduke Maximilian, who afterward became Archbishop of
Cologne, and was the patron of Beethoven. [The ambiguity of the

<h3 id="id00333" style="margin-top: 3em">WOLFGANG, THE GERMAN</h3>

<p id="id00334" style="margin-top: 3em">Mozart's Germanism is a matter of pride to the German people. To
him "German" was no empty concept, as it was to the majority of
his contemporaries. He is therefore honored as a champion of
German character and German art, worthy as such to stand beside
Richard Wagner. Properly to appreciate his patriotism it is
necessary to hear in mind that in Mozart's day Germany was a
figment of the imagination, the French language, French manners
and Italian music being everywhere dominant. Wagner, on the
contrary, was privileged to see the promise of the fulfillment of
his strivings in the light of the German victories of 1870-1871.
When the genius of Germany soared aloft she carried Wagner with
her; Wagner's days of glory in August, 1876, were conditioned by
the great war with France. How insignificant must the patronage
of Joseph II, scantily enough bestowed on Mozart in comparison
with that showered on Salieri, appear, when we recall the
Maecenas Ludwig II.</p>

<p id="id00335" style="margin-top: 3em">109. "Frequently I fall into a mood of complete listlessness and
indifference; nothing gives me great pleasure. The most
stimulating and encouraging thought is that you, dearest father,
and my dear sister, are well, that I am an honest German, and
that if I am not always permitted to talk I can think what I
please; but that is all."</p>

<p id="id00336">(Paris, May 29, 1778, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00337">110. "The Duke de Guines was utterly without a sense of honor and
thought that here was a young fellow, and a stupid German to
boot,—as all Frenchmen think of the Germans,—he'll be glad to
take it. But the stupid German was not glad and refused to take
the money. For two lessons he wanted to pay me the fee of one."</p>

<p id="id00338">(Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father. Mozart had given lessons in
composition to the Duke's daughter. See No. 51.)</p>

<p id="id00339">111. "An Italian ape, such as he is, who has lived in German
countries and eaten German bread for years, ought to speak
German, or mangle it, as well or ill as his French mouth will
permit."</p>

<p id="id00340">(Said of the violoncellist Duport, the favorite of King William
I, of Prussia, in 1789, when Mozart was in Berlin and Duport
asked him to speak French.)</p>

<p id="id00341">112. "I pray God every day to give me grace to remain steadfast
here, that I may do honor to myself and the entire German nation,
to His greater honor and glory, and that He permit me to make my
fortune so that I may help you out of your sorry condition, and
bring it to pass that we soon meet again and live together in
happiness and joy. But His will be done on earth as in heaven."</p>

<p id="id00342">(Paris, May 1, 1778, to his father who had plunged himself in
debt and was giving lessons in order to promote the career of his
son. His sister also helped nobly.)</p>

<p id="id00343">113. "If this were a place where the people had ears, hearts to
feel, and a modicum of musical understanding and taste, I should
laugh heartily at all these things; as it is I am among nothing
but cattle and brutes (so far as music is concerned). How should
it be otherwise since they are the same in all their acts and
passions? There is no place like Paris. You must not think
that I exaggerate when I talk thus of music. Turn to whom you
please,—except to a born Frenchman,—you shall hear the same
thing, provided you can find some one to turn to. Now that I am
here I must endure out of regard for you. I shall thank God
Almighty if I get out of here with a sound taste."</p>

<p id="id00345">114. "How popular I would be if I were to lift the national
German stage to recognition in music! And this would surely
happen for I was already full of desire to write when I heard the
German Singspiel."</p>

spoken dialogue. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00347">115. "If there were but a single patriot on the boards with me, a
different face would be put on the matter. Then, mayhap, the
budding National Theatre would blossom, and that would be an
eternal disgrace to Germany,—if we Germans should once begin to
think German, act German, speak German, and—even sing German!!!"</p>

<p id="id00348">(Vienna, March 21, 1785, to the playwright Anton Klein of<br/>

Mannheim. It was purposed to open the Singspiel theatre in<br/>

October.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00349">116. "The German Opera is to be opened in October. For my part I
am not promising it much luck. From the doings so far it looks as
if an effort were making thoroughly to destroy the German opera
which had suspended, perhaps only for a while, rather than to
help it up again and preserve it. Only my sister-in-law Lange has
been engaged for the German Singspiel. Cavalieri, Adamberger,
Teyber, all Germans, of whom Germany can be proud, must remain
with the Italian opera, must make war against their countrymen!"</p>

<p id="id00350">(Vienna, March 21, 1785, to Anton Klein. Madame Lange was Aloysia<br/>

Weber, with whom he was in love before he married her sister<br/>

Constanze.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00351">117. "The gentlemen of Vienna (including most particularly the
Emperor) must not be permitted to believe that I live only for
the sake of Vienna. There is no monarch on the face of the earth
whom I would rather serve than the Emperor, but I shall not beg
service. I believe that I am capable of doing honor to any court.
If Germany, my beloved fatherland, of whom you know I am proud,
will not accept me, then must I, in the name of God, again make
France or England richer by one capable German;—and to the shame
of the German nation. You know full well that in nearly all the
arts those who excelled have nearly always been Germans. But
where did they find fortune, where fame? Certainly not in
Germany. Even Gluck;—did Germany make him a great man? Alas,
no!"</p>

<p id="id00352">(Vienna, August 17, 1782, to his father. Mozart's answer in 1789,
when King Frederick William II of Prussia said to him: "Stay with
me; I offer you a salary of 3,000 thalers," was touching in the
extreme: "Shall I leave my good Emperor?" Thereupon the king
said: "Think it over. I'll keep my word even if you should come
after a year and a day!" In spite of his financial difficulties,
Mozart never gave serious consideration to the offer. When his
father advised him against some of his foreign plans he answered:
"So far as France and England are concerned you are wholly right;
this opening will never be closed to me; it will be better if I
wait a while longer. Meanwhile it is possible that conditions may
change in those countries." In a preceding letter he had written:
"For some time I have been practicing myself daily in the French
language, and I have also taken three lessons in English. In
three months I hope to be able to read and understand English
books fairly well.")</p>

<p id="id00353">118. "The two of us played a sonata that I had composed for the
occasion, and which had a success. This sonata I shall send you
by Herr von Daubrawaick, who said that he would feel proud to
have it in his trunk; his son, who is a Salzburger, told me this.
When the father went he said, quite loud, 'I am proud to be your
countryman. You are doing great honor to Salzburg; I hope that
times will so change that we can have you amongst us, and then do
not forget me.' I answered: 'My fatherland has always the first
claim on me.' "</p>

<p id="id00354">(Vienna, November 24, 1781, to his father. Mozart is speaking of
a concert which he had given. The sonata is the small one in D
major (Kochel, No. 381). Mozart often made merry over the
Salzburgians; he called them stupid and envious.)</p>

<p id="id00355">119. "Thoroughly convinced that I was talking to a German, I gave
free rein to my tongue,—a thing which one is so seldom permitted
to do that after such an outpouring of the heart it would be
allowable to get a bit fuddled without risk of hurting one's
health."</p>

<p id="id00356">(Vienna, March 21, 1785, to Anton Klein.)</p>

<h3 id="id00357" style="margin-top: 3em">SELF-RESPECT AND HONOR</h3>

<p id="id00358" style="margin-top: 3em">Beethoven is said to have been the first musician who compelled
respect for his craft,—he who, prouder than Goethe, associated
with royalties, and said of himself, "I, too, am a king!" Mozart
rose from a dependent position which brought him most grievous
humiliations; he was looked upon as a servant of the Archbishop
of Salzburg, and treated accordingly. At the time composers
and musicians had no higher standing. Mozart feels the
intolerableness of his position and protests against it on every
opportunity; he is conscious of his worth and intellectual
superiority. When he endures the grossest indignities from his
tormentor, Archbishop Hieronymus, it is for the sake of his
father whom he would save from annoyance. In all things else
he follows the example of his father, but in the matter of
self-respect he admonishes and encourages his parent. Although
Beethoven rudely rejected the condescending good will of the
great which would have made Mozart happy, and demanded respect
as an equal, it must be confessed that the generally manly
conduct of Mozart was an excellent preparation of the Viennese
soil.</p>

<p id="id00359">120. "I only wish that the Elector were here; he might hear
something to his advantage. He knows nothing about me, knows
nothing about my ability. What a pity that these grand gentlemen
take everybody's word and are unwilling to investigate for
themselves! It's always the way. I am willing to make a test; let
him summon all the composers in Munich, and even invite a few
from Italy, Germany, England and Spain; I will trust myself in a
competition with them all."</p>

<p id="id00360">(Munich, October 2, 1777, to his father. Mozart had hoped to
secure an appointment in Munich, but was disappointed.)</p>

<p id="id00361">121. "I could scarcely refrain from laughing when I was
introduced to the people. A few, who knew me par renommee, were
very polite and respectful; others who know nothing about me
stared at me as if they were a bit amused. They think that
because I am small and young that there can be nothing great and
old in me. But they shall soon find out."</p>

<p id="id00362">(Mannheim, October 31, 1777, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00363">122. "We poor, common folk must not only take wives whom we love
and who love us, but we may, can and want to take such because we
are neither noble, well-born nor rich, but lowly, mean and poor.
Hence we do not need rich wives because our wealth dies with us,
being in our heads. Of this wealth no man can rob us unless he
cuts off our heads, in which case we should have need of nothing
more."</p>

<p id="id00364">(Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father. Mozart had fallen in
love with Aloysia, daughter of the poor musician Weber.)</p>

<p id="id00365">123. "I will gladly give lessons to oblige, particularly if I see
that a person has talent and a joyous desire to learn. But to go
to a house at a fixed hour, or wait at home for the arrival of
some one, that I can not do, no matter how much it might yield
me; I leave that to others who can do nothing else than play the
clavier,—for me it is impossible. I am a composer and was born
to be a chapelmaster. I dare not thus bury the talent for
composition which a kind God gave me in such generous measure (I
may say this without pride for I feel it now more than ever
before), and that is what I should do had I many pupils. Teaching
is a restless occupation and I would rather neglect clavier
playing than composition; the clavier is a side issue, though,
thank God, a strong one."</p>

<p id="id00366">(Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father, who must have read
the words with sorrow, since he and his daughter Nannerl were
laboriously giving lessons and practicing economy to make
Mozart's journey possible and had to advance money to him.)</p>

<p id="id00367">124. "I know of a certainty that the Emperor intends to establish
a German opera in Vienna, and is earnestly seeking a young
conductor who understands the German language, has genius and is
capable of giving the world something new. Benda of Gotha is
seeking the place and Schweitzer is also an applicant. I believe
this would be a good thing for me,—but with good pay, as a
matter of course. If the Emperor will give me a thousand florins,
I will write a German opera for him, and if then he does not wish
to retain me, all right. I beg of you, write to all the good
friends in Vienna whom you can think of that I would do honor to
the Emperor. If there is no other way let him try me with an
opera."</p>

<p id="id00368">(Mannheim, January 10, 1778, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00369">125. "The greatest favor that Herr Grimm showed me was to lend me
15 Louis d'Or in driblets at the (life and) death of my blessed
mother. Is he fearful that the loan will not be returned? If so
he truly deserves a kick—for he shows distrust of my honesty
(the only thing that can throw me into a rage), and also of my
talent….In a word he belongs to the Italian party, is deceitful
and is seeking to oppress me."</p>

<p id="id00370">(Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, who was on a friendly
footing with the French encyclopaedist Grimm since the first
artistic tour made with little Wolfgang in 1763, when he owed
many favors to Grimm. Apparently Mozart here does an injustice to
his patron, who, it is true, thought highly of the Italian
Piccini.)</p>

<p id="id00371">126. "On my honor, I can't help it; it's the kind of man I am.
Lately when he spoke to me rudely, foolishly and stupidly, I did
not dare to say to him that he need not worry about the 15 Louis
d'Or for fear that I might offend him. I did nothing but endure
and ask if he were ready; and then—your obedient servant."</p>

<p id="id00372">(Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, at whose request Baron
Grimm had received the young artist in Paris, but at the same
time had exercised a sort of artistic guardianship over him.

write to him do not be too humble in your thanks;—there are
reasons." On another occasion: "Grimm is able to assist children,
but not adults. Do not imagine that he is the man he was.")</p>

<p id="id00373">127. "You know that I want nothing more than good employment,—

the service of the archiepiscopal court at Salzburg.)</p>

<p id="id00375">128. "The Prince must have confidence either in you or me, and
give us complete control of everything relating to music;
otherwise all will be in vain. For in Salzburg everybody or
nobody has to do with music. If I were to undertake it I should
demand free hands. In matters musical the Head Court Chamberlain
should have nothing to say; a cavalier can not be a conductor,
but a conductor can well be a cavalier."</p>

<p id="id00376">(Paris, July 9, 1778.)</p>

<p id="id00377">129. "If the Archbishop were to entrust it to me I would soon
make his music famous, that's sure….But I have one request to
make at Salzburg, and that is that I shall not be placed among
the violins where I used to be; I'll never make a fiddler. I will
conduct at the clavier and accompany the arias. It would have
been a good thing if I had secured a written assurance of the
conductorship."</p>

<p id="id00378">(Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father who had urged him to

heart if I were not aware that I have taken service there; it is
only this thought that is intolerable. Put yourself in my place

am everything and at times nothing. I do not demand too much or
too little;—only something, if I am something."</p>

<p id="id00380">(Strassburg, October 15, 1778, to his father, while returning

Salzburg! As I have said I experience great pleasure when I think
of visiting you again, but nothing but vexation and fear at the
thought of seeing myself at that beggarly court again. The

used to; it is not impossible, it is even likely that I would put

insignificance. N.B. The two valets sit at the head of the table;
I have at least the honor of sitting above the cooks. Well, I
simply think I am at Salzburg. At dinner a great many coarse and

as I live,—and I beg of you, I beg of you for the sake of
everything in the world, encourage me in my determination instead
of trying to dissuade me. That would unfit me for what I must do.

<p id="id00393">137. "If it be happiness to be rid of a prince who never pays
one, but torments him to death, then I am happy. For if I had to
work from morning till night I would do it gladly rather than
live off the bounty of such a,—I do not dare to call him by the
name he deserves,—I was forced to take the step I did and I can
not swerve a hair's breadth from it; impossible."</p>

<p id="id00394">(Vienna, May 19, 1781.)</p>

<p id="id00395">138. "Salzburg is nothing now to me except it offer an
opportunity to give the Count a kick…even if it were in the
public street. I desire no satisfaction from the Archbishop, for
he is not in a position to offer me the kind that I want and must
have. Within a day or two I shall write to the Count telling him
what he can confidently expect to receive from me the first time
I meet him, be it where it may, except a place that commands my
respect."</p>

<p id="id00396">(Vienna, June 13, 1781, to his father. Count Arco's offence has
been mentioned. On June 16 Mozart wrote: "The hungry ass shall
not escape my chastisement if I have to wait twenty years; for as
soon as I see him he shall come in contact with my foot, unless I
should be so unfortunate as to see him in the sanctuary." [The
reader will probably guess that the translator is resorting to
euphemisms in rendering Mozart's language. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00397">139. "It is the heart that confers the patent of nobility on man;
and although I am no count I probably have more honor within me
than many a count. Menial or count, whoever insults me is a cur.
I shall begin by representing to him, with complete gravity, how
badly he did his business, but at the end I shall have to assure
him in writing that he is to expect a kick…and a box on the
ear from me; for if a man insults me I have got to be revenged,
and if I give him no more than he gave me, it is mere retaliation
and not punishment. Besides I should thus put myself on a level
with him, and I am too proud to compare myself with such a stupid
gelding."</p>

<p id="id00398">(Vienna, June 20, 1781, to his father. These expressions, called
out by the insulting treatment received from the Archbishop and
Count Arco, are in striking contrast to Mozart's habitual
amiability.)</p>

<p id="id00399">140. "I can easily believe that the court parasites will look
askance at you, but why need you disturb yourself about such a
miserable pack? The more inimical such persons are to you the
greater the pride and contempt with which you should look down
upon them."</p>

<p id="id00400">(Vienna, June 20, 1778, to his father, who fears that some of the
consequences of his son's step may be visited upon him.)</p>

<p id="id00401">141. "I do not ask of you that you make a disturbance or enter
the least complaint, but the Archbishop and the whole pack must
fear to speak to you about this matter, for you (if compelled)
can without the slightest alarm say frankly that you would be
ashamed to have reared a son who would have accepted abuse from
such an infamous cur as Arco; and you may assure all that if I
had the good luck to meet him today I should treat him as he
deserves, and that he would have occasion to remember me the
rest of his life. All that I want is that everybody shall see
in your bearing that you have nothing to fear. Keep quiet; but
if necessary, speak, and then to some purpose."</p>

<p id="id00402">(Vienna, July 4, 1781, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00403">142. "I may say that because of Vogler, Winter was always my
greatest enemy. But because he is a beast in his mode of life,
and in all other matters a child, I would be ashamed to set down
a single word on his account; he deserves the contempt of all
honorable men. I will, therefore, not tell infamous truths rather
than infamous lies about him."</p>

<p id="id00404">(Vienna, December 22, 1781, to his father, to whose ears Peter<br/>

Winter, a composer, had brought slanderous reports concerning<br/>

Mozart and his Constanze. Winter was a pupil of Abbe Vogler. See<br/>

No. 66.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00405">143. "He is a nice fellow and a good friend of mine; I might
often dine with him, but it is a custom with me never to take pay
for my favors; nor would a dish of soup pay them. Yet such people
have wonderful notions of what they accomplish with one….I am
fond of doing favors for people but they must not plague me. She
(the daughter) is not satisfied if I spend two hours every day
with her, but wants me to loll about the whole day; yet she tries
to play the well behaved one."</p>

<p id="id00406">(Vienna, August 22, 1781, to his father. Mozart is writing about
a landlord and his daughter concerning whom favorable reports had
reached the ears of the father. Mozart explains matters and soon
thereafter announces a change of lodgings.)</p>

<p id="id00407">144. "I beg of you that when you write to me about something in
my conduct which is displeasing to you, and I in turn give you my
views, let it always be a matter between father and son, and
therefore a secret not to be divulged to others. Let our letters
suffice and do not address yourself to others, for, by heaven, I
will not give a finger's length of accounting concerning my
doings or omissions to others, not even to the Emperor himself. I
have cares and anxieties of my own and have no use for petulant
letters."</p>

<p id="id00408">(Vienna, September 5, 1781, to his father, who lent a willing ear
to gossips and was never chary of his reproaches. Mozart was
already twenty-five years old.)</p>

<p id="id00409">145. "If I were Wiedmer I would demand the following satisfaction
from the Emperor: he should endure 50 strokes at the same place
in my presence and then he should pay me 6,000 ducats. If I could
not obtain this satisfaction I should take none, but thrust a
dagger through his heart at the first opportunity. N.B. He has
already had an offer of 3,000 ducats on condition that he does
not come to Vienna, but permits the matter to drop. The people of
Innsbruck say of Wiedmer: he who was scourged for our sake will
also redeem us."</p>

<p id="id00410">(Vienna, August 8, 1781, to his father. Herr von Wiedmer was a
nobleman and theatre director, who, without cause, had been
sentenced to a whipping by the president, Count Wolkenstein, on
the complaint of another nobleman. [Mozart's bloodthirstiness was
probably due to memories of Arco's kick still rankling in his
heart. It was only after long solicitation from his father that
he abandoned his plan to send Arco the threatened letter.
H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00411">146. "You perhaps already know that the musico Marquesi—
Marquesius di Milano—was poisoned in Naples; but how! He was
in love with a duchess and her real amant grew jealous and sent
three or four bravos to Marquesi and left him the choice of
drinking poison or being massacred. He chose the poison. Being a
timid Italian he died alone and left his gentlemen murderers to
live in rest and peace. Had they come into my room, I would have
taken a few of them with me into the other world, as long as some
one had to die. Pity for so excellent a singer!"</p>

<p id="id00412">(Munich, December 30, 1780, to his father. Mozart, on the whole,
was one of the most peaceable men on earth, but he was not
wanting in personal courage, and he could fly into transports of
rage.)</p>

<p id="id00413">147. "If you were to write also to Prince Zeil I should be glad.
But short and good. Do not by any means crawl! That I can not
endure."</p>

<p id="id00414">(Mannheim, December 10, 1777, to his father. Count Ferdinand von
Zeil was Prince Bishop of Chimsee and favorably disposed towards
Mozart, who was hoping for an appointment in Munich. "If he wants
to do something he can; all Munich told me that." Nothing came of
it.)</p>

<p id="id00415">148. "Whoever judges me by such bagatelles is also a scamp!"</p>

<p id="id00416">(Mozart wrote many occasional pieces for his friends,—fitting
them to the players' capacities. Mozart said that the publisher
who bought some of these "bagatelles" and printed them without
applying to him was a scamp (Lump), but took no proceedings
against him.)</p>

<p id="id00417">149. "Very well; then I shall earn nothing more, go hungry and
the devil a bit will I care!"</p>

<p id="id00418">(Mozart's answer to Hofmeister, the Leipsic publisher, who had
said: "Write in a more popular style or I can neither print nor

ceasing, a peculiar help in this direction being that one
enlightens the other by communicating his ideas; in the sciences
and fine arts there is always more to learn."</p>

opinion he asks concerning a motet which the Archbishop of
Salzburg had faulted.)</p>

part."</p>

<p id="id00423">(Bologna, September 8, 1770, to his mother and sister.)</p>

<p id="id00424">152. "Because you said yesterday that you could understand
anything, and that I might write what I please in Latin,
curiosity has led me to try you with some Latin lines. Have the
kindness when you have solved the problem to send the result to
me by the Hagenauer servant maid."</p>

<p id="id00425">"Cuperem scire, de qua causa, a quam plurimis adolescentibus

language, and already taken three lessons in English. In three
months I hope to be able to read and understand the English books
fairly well."</p>

<p id="id00428">(Vienna, August 17, 1782, to his father. Mozart had given it out
that he intended to go to Paris or London. Prince Kaunitz had
said to Archduke Maximilian that men like Mozart lived but once
in a hundred years, and should not be driven out of Germany.
Mozart, however, writes to his father: "But I do not want to wait
on charity; I find that, even if it were the Emperor, I am not
dependent on his bounty.")</p>

<p id="id00429">154. "I place my confidence in three friends, and they are strong
and invincible friends, viz: God, your head and my head. True our
heads differ, but each is very good, serviceable, and useful in
its genre, and in time I hope that my head will be as good as
yours in the field in which now yours is superior."</p>

<p id="id00430">(Mannheim, February 28, 1778, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00431">155. "Believe me, I do not love idleness, but work. True it was
difficult in Salzburg and cost me an effort and I could scarcely
persuade myself. Why? Because I was not happy there. You must
admit that, for me at least, there was not a pennyworth of
entertainment in Salzburg. I do not want to associate with many
and of the majority of the rest I am not fond. There is no
encouragement for my talent! If I play, or one of my compositions
is performed, the audience might as well consist of tables and
chairs….In Salzburg I sigh for a hundred amusements, and here
for not one; to live in Vienna is amusement enough."</p>

<p id="id00432">(Vienna, May 26, 1781, to his father, who was concerned as to the
progress making in Vienna.)</p>

<p id="id00433">156. "I beg of you, best and dearest of fathers, do not write me
any more letters of this kind,—I conjure you, for they serve no
other purpose than to heat my head and disturb my heart and mood.
And I, who must compose continually, need a clear head and quiet
mood."</p>

<p id="id00434">(Vienna, June 9, 1781, to his father, who had reproached him
because of his rupture with the Archbishop.)</p>

<p id="id00435">157. "If there ever was a time when I was not thinking about
marriage it is now. I wish for nothing less than a rich wife, and
if I could make my fortune by marriage now I should perforce have
to wait, because I have very different things in my head. God did
not give me my talent to put it a-dangle on a wife, and spend my
young life in inactivity. I am just beginning life, and shall I
embitter it myself? I have nothing against matrimony, but for me
it would be an evil just now."</p>

<p id="id00436">(Vienna, July 25, 1781, to his father, who was solicitous lest he
fall in love with one of the daughters in the Weber family with
whom he was living. All manner of rumors had been carried to him.
The father persuaded his son to seek other lodgings; but
Constanze Weber eventually became Mozart's wife nevertheless.)</p>

<p id="id00437">158. "This sort of composer can do nothing in this genre. He has
no conception of what is wanted. Lord! if God had only given me
such a place in the church and before such an orchestra!"</p>

<p id="id00438">(A remark made in Leipsic, in 1789, in reference to a composer
who was suited to comic opera work, but had received an
appointment as Church composer. Mozart examined a mass of his and
said: "It sounds all very well, but not in church." He then
played it through with new words improvised by himself, such as
(in the Cum sancto spiritu) "Stolen property, gentlemen, but no
offence.")</p>

<p id="id00439">159. "You see my intentions are good; but if you can't, you
can't! I do not want to scribble, and therefore can not send you
the whole symphony before next post day."</p>

<p id="id00440">(Vienna, July 31, 1782, to his father, who had asked for a
symphony for the Hafner family in Salzburg.)</p>

he himself apply to himself for pardon in my behalf, with the
assurance that as soon as I can do so in quiet I shall write to
him. Until now no such occasion has offered itself, for as soon
as I know that in all likelihood I must leave a place I have no
restful hour. And although I still have a modicum of hope, I am
not at ease and shall not be until I know my status."</p>

<p id="id00442">(Mannheim, November 22, 1777, to his father. Abbe Bullinger was

Mozart had been negligent in his correspondence.)</p>

attentively; and I—I forgot the cold, and the headache and
played regardless of the wretched clavier as I play when I am in
the mood. Give me the best clavier in Europe and at the same time
hearers who understand nothing or want to understand nothing, and
who do not feel what I play with me, and all my joy is gone."</p>

<p id="id00446">(Paris, May 1, 1778, to his father. The Duchess had behaved very
haughtily and kept Mozart sitting in a cold room for a long time
before the Duke came.)</p>
