  <body><h3 id="id00447" style="margin-top: 3em">AT HOME AND ABROAD</h3>

<p id="id00448" style="margin-top: 3em">163. "I assure you that without travel we (at least men of the
arts and sciences) are miserable creatures. A man of mediocre
talent will remain mediocre whether he travel or not; but a man
of superior talent (which I can not deny I am, without doing
wrong) deteriorates if he remains continually in one place."</p>

<p id="id00449">(Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, who had secured an
appointment for him at Salzburg which he was loath to accept. He
asked that the Archbishop permit him to travel once in two years.
He feared that he "would find no congenial society" in Salzburg,
where, moreover, music did not stand in large appreciation.
Mozart's subsequent experiences were of the most pitiable
character.)</p>

<p id="id00450">164. "Write me, how is Mr. Canary? Does he still sing? Does he
still pipe? Do you know why I am thinking of the canary? Because
there is one in our anteroom that makes the same little sounds as
ours."</p>

<p id="id00451">(Naples, May 19, 1770, to his sister. Mozart was very fond of
animals. In a letter from Vienna to his sister on August 21,
1773, he writes: "How is Miss Bimbes? Please present all manner
of compliments to her." "Miss Bimbes" was a dog. At another time
he wrote a pathetic little poem on the death of a starling. While
in the midst of the composition and rehearsal of "Idomeneo" he
wrote to his father: "Give Pimperl (a dog) a pinch of Spanish
snuff, a good wine-biscuit and three busses.")</p>

<p id="id00452">165. "Because of my disposition which leans towards a quiet,
domestic life rather than to boisterousness, and the fact that
since my youth I have never given a thought to my linen, clothing
or such things, I can think of nothing more necessary than a
wife. I assure you that I frequently spend money unnecessarily
because I am negligent of these things. I am convinced that I
could get along better than I do now on the same income if I had
a wife. How many unnecessary expenditures would be saved? Others
are added, it is true, but you know in advance what they are and
can adjust them;—in a word you lead a regulated life. In my
opinion an unmarried man lives only half a life; that is my
conviction and I can not help it. I have resolved the matter over
and over in my mind and am of the same opinion still."</p>

<p id="id00453">(Vienna, December 15, 1781, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00454">166. "At present I have only one pupil….I could have several if
I were to lower my fee; but as soon as one does that one loses
credit. My price is twelve lessons for six ducats, and I make it
understood besides that I give the lessons as a favor. I would
rather have three pupils who pay well than six who pay ill. I am
writing this to you to prevent you from thinking that it is
selfishness which prevents me from sending you more than thirty
ducats."</p>

<p id="id00455">(Vienna, June 16, 1781, to his father. [In American money<br/>

Mozart's fee is represented by $1.20 per lesson. H.E.K.])<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00456">167. "I could not go about Vienna looking like a tramp,
particularly just at this time. My linen was pitiable; no servant
here has shirts of such coarse stuff as mine,—and that certainly
is a frightful thing for a man. Consequently there were again
expenditures. I had only one pupil; she suspended her lessons for
three weeks, and I was again the loser. One must not throw one's
self away here,—that is a first principle,—or one is ruined
forever. The most audacious man wins the day."</p>

<p id="id00457">(Vienna, September 5, 1781, to his father, excusing himself for
not having made remittances.)</p>

<p id="id00458">168. "Resent anything and at once you receive smaller pay.
Besides all this the Emperor is a skinflint. If the Emperor wants
me he ought to pay for me; the mere honor of being in his employ
is not enough. If the Emperor were to offer me 1,000 florins and
a count 2,000, I should present my compliments to the Emperor and
go to the count,—assuming a guarantee, of course."</p>

<p id="id00459">(Vienna, April 10, 1782, to his father. Mozart was not too
industrious in the pursuit of a court appointment, yet had reason
to be hopeful. Near the end of his short life the appointment
came from Joseph II, to whom Mozart had been too faithful.)</p>

<p id="id00460">169. "I described my manner of life to my father only recently,
and I will now repeat it to you. At six o'clock in the morning I
am already done with my friseur, and at seven I am fully dressed.
Thereupon I compose until nine o'clock. From nine to one I give
lessons; then I eat unless I am a guest at places where they dine
at two or even three o'clock,—as, for instance, today and
tomorrow with Countess Zichy and Countess Thun. I can not work
before five or six o'clock in the evening and I am often
prevented even then by a concert; if not I write till nine. Then
I go to my dear Constanze, where the delight of our meeting is
generally embittered by the words of her mother;—hence my desire
to free and save her as soon as possible. At half after ten or
eleven I am again at home. Since (owing to the occasional
concerts and the uncertainty as to whether or not I may be called
out) I can not depend on having time for composition in the
evening, I am in the habit (particularly when I come home early)
of writing something before I go to bed. Frequently I forget
myself and write till one o'clock,—then up again at six."</p>

<p id="id00461">(Vienna, February 13, 1782, to his sister Marianne—Nannerl, as
he called her.)</p>

<p id="id00462">170. "We do not go to bed before 12 o'clock and get up half after
five or five, because nearly every day we take an early walk in
the Augarten."</p>

<p id="id00463">(Vienna, May 26, 1784, to his father, to whom he complains of his
maid-servant who came from Salzburg and who had written to the
father that she was not permitted to sleep except between 11 and
6 o'clock.)</p>

<p id="id00464">171. "Now as to my mode of life: As soon as you were gone I
played two games of billiards with Herr von Mozart who wrote the
opera for Schickaneder's theatre; then I sold my nag for fourteen
ducats; then I had Joseph call my primus and bring a black
coffee, to which I smoked a glorious pipe of tobacco….At 5:30 I
went out of the door and took my favorite promenade through the
Glacis to the theatre. What do I see? What do I smell? It is the
primus with the cutlet Gusto! I eat to your health. It has just
struck 11 o'clock. Perhaps you are already asleep. Sh! sh! sh! I
do not want to wake you."</p>

<p id="id00465">"Saturday, the 8th. You ought to have seen me yesterday at
supper! I could not find the old dishes and therefore produced a
set as white as snow-flowers and had the wax candelabra in front
of me."</p>

<p id="id00466">(Vienna, October 7, 1791, to his wife, who was taking the waters
at Baden. Mozart was fond of billiards and often played alone as
on this occasion. He was careful of his health and had been
advised by his physician to ride; but he could not acquire a
taste for the exercise—Hence the sale of his horse. The primus
was his valet, a servant found in every Viennese household at the
time. Out of the door through which he stepped on beginning his
walk to the theatre his funeral procession passed two months
later.)</p>

<p id="id00467">172. "I have done more work during the ten days that I have lived
here than in two months in any other lodgings; and if it were not
that I am too often harassed by gloomy thoughts which I can
dispel only by force, I could do still more, for I live
pleasantly, comfortably and cheaply."</p>

<p id="id00468">(Vienna, June 27, 1788, to his friend Puchberg.)</p>

<p id="id00469">173. "I have no conveniences for writing there (i.e. at Baden),
and I want to avoid embarrassments as much as possible. Nothing
is more enjoyable than a quiet life and to obtain that one must
be industrious. I am glad to be that."</p>

<p id="id00470">(Vienna, October 8, 1791, to his wife at Baden. Mozart probably
refers to work on his "Requiem." He says further: "If I had had
nothing to do I would have gone with you to spend the week.")</p>

<p id="id00471">174. "Now the babe against my will, yet with my consent, has been
provided with a wet nurse. It was always my determination that,
whether she was able to do so or not, my wife was not to suckle
her child; but neither was the child to guzzle the milk of
another woman. I want it brought up on water as I and my sister
were, but…"</p>

<p id="id00472">(Vienna, June 8, 1783, to his father, the day after his first
child was born. The "Dear, thick, fat little fellow" died soon
after.)</p>

<p id="id00473">175. "Young as I am, I never go to bed without thinking that
possibly I may not be alive on the morrow; yet not one of the
many persons who know me can say that I am morose or melancholy.
For this happy disposition I thank my Creator daily, and wish
with all my heart that it were shared by all my fellows."</p>

<p id="id00474">(Vienna, April 4, 1787, to his father, shortly before the
latter's death. Mozart himself died when, he was not quite
thirty-six years old.)</p>

<p id="id00475">176. "If it chances to be convenient I shall call on the Fischers
for a moment; longer than that I could not endure their warm room
and the wine at table. I know very well that people of their
class think they are bestowing the highest honors when they offer
these things, but I am not fond of such things,—still less of
such people."</p>

<p id="id00476">(Vienna, December 22, 1781, to his sister. Mozart was acquainted
with the Fischer family from the time of his first journeys as a
child. The contrast which he draws between the artist and the
comfort-loving, commonplace citizen is diverting.)</p>

<p id="id00477">177. "The Viennese are a people who soon grow weary and
listless,—but only of the theatre. My forte is too popular to be
neglected. This, surely, is Clavierland!"</p>

<p id="id00478">(Spoken to Count Arco who had warned him against removing to
Vienna because of the fickleness of the Viennese public. He
wanted him to return to Salzburg.)</p>

<p id="id00479">178. "I am writing at a place called Reisenberg which is an
hour's distance from Vienna. I once stayed here over night; now I
shall remain a few days. The house is insignificant, but the
surroundings, the woods in which a grotto has been built as
natural as can be, are splendid and very pleasant."</p>

<p id="id00480">(Vienna, July 13, 1781, to his father. Like Beethoven, Mozart
loved nature and wanted a garden about his home.)</p>

<p id="id00481">179. "I wish that my sister were here in Rome. I am sure she
would be pleased with the city, for St. Peter's church is
regular, and many other things in Rome are regular."</p>

<p id="id00482">(Rome, April 14, 1770. A droll criticism from the traveling
virtuoso, aged 14, in a letter to his mother and sister.)</p>

<p id="id00483">180. "Carefully thinking it over I conclude that in no country
have I received so many honors or been so highly appreciated
as in Italy. You get credit in Italy if you have written an
opera,—especially in Naples."</p>

<p id="id00484">(Munich, October 11, 1777, to his father. An influential friend
had offered to help him get an appointment in Italy.)</p>

<p id="id00485">181. "Strassburg can't get along without me. You have no idea how
I am honored and loved here. The people say that everything I do
is refined, that I am so sedate and courteous and have so good a
bearing. Everybody knows me."</p>

<p id="id00486">(Strassburg, October 26, 1778, to his father, on his return
journey from Paris. On October 3 he had written: "I beg your
pardon if I cannot write much. It is because, unless I am in a
city in which I am well known, I am never in a good humor. If I
were acquainted here I would gladly stay, for the city is truly
charming—beautiful houses, handsome broad streets, and superb
squares.")</p>

<p id="id00487">182. "Oh, what a difference between the people of the Palatinate
and of Bavaria! What a language! How coarse! To say nothing of
the mode of life!"</p>

<p id="id00488">(Mannheim, November 12, 1778, to his father. Mozart, while
returning from Paris, had stopped at his "dear Mannheim," where
at the moment a regiment of Bavarian soldiers were quartered, and
had just got news of the rudeness with which the people of Munich
had treated their Elector.)</p>

<p id="id00489">183. "In Regensburg we dined magnificently at noon, listened to
divine table music, had angelic service and glorious Mosel wine.
We breakfasted in Nuremberg,—a hideous city. At Wurzburg we
strengthened our stomachs with coffee; a beautiful, a splendid
city. The charges were moderate everywhere. Only two post relays
from here, in Aschaffenburg, the landlord swindled us
shamefully."</p>

<p id="id00490">(Frankfort-on-the-Main, September 29, 1790, to his wife. The
remark is notable because of the judgments pronounced on the
renaissance city Nuremberg, and the rococo city Wurzburg.)</p>

<p id="id00491">184. "All the talk about the imperial cities is mere boasting. I
am famous, admired and loved here, it is true, but the people are
worse than the Viennese in their parsimony."</p>

<p id="id00492">(Mozart went to Frankfort, in 1790, on the occasion of the
coronation of the emperor, hoping to make enough money with
concerts to help himself out of financial difficulties, but
failed.)</p>

<h3 id="id00493" style="margin-top: 3em">LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<p id="id00494" style="margin-top: 3em">Mozart's love for his father made him dependent on the latter to
the end of his days. He was a model son and must have loved his
wife devotedly, since, for her sake, he once in his life
disobeyed his father. The majority of his letters which have been
preserved are addressed to his father, to whom he reported all
his happenings and whose advice he is forever seeking. Similar
were his relations with his sister Marianne (Nannerl), whom he
loved with great tenderness. The letters to his wife are unique;
all of them, even the last, seem to be the letters of a lover.
They were a pair of turtle-doves.</p>

<p id="id00495">Mozart was an ideal friend, ready to sacrifice to the uttermost
on the altar of friendship. It was this trait of character which
made him throw himself with enthusiasm into Freemasonry, whose
affiliations he sought to widen by drafting the constitution of a
community which he called "The Grotto." He probably hated only
one man in the world,—the Archbishop of Salzburg, his tormentor.</p>

<p id="id00496">185. "The moment you do not trust me I shall distrust myself.
The time is past, it is true, when I used to stand on the settle,
sing oragna fiagata fa and kiss the tip end of your nose; but
have I therefore shown laxity in respect, love and obedience?
I say no more."</p>

<p id="id00497">(Mannheim, February 19, 1779, to his father, who was vexed
because Mozart was showing a disposition to stay in Mannheim,
because of a love affair, instead of going to Paris. "Off with
you to Paris, and soon!" wrote the father. The Italian words are
meaningless and but a bit of child's play, the nature of which
can be gathered from Mozart's remark.)</p>

<p id="id00498">186. "Pray do not let your mind often harbor the thought that I
shall ever forget you! It is intolerable to me. My chief aim in
life has been, is, and will be to strive so that we may soon be
reunited and happy….Reflect that you have a son who will never
consciously forget his filial duty toward you, and who will labor
ever to grow more worthy of so good a father."</p>

<p id="id00499">(Mannheim, February 28, 1778, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00500">187. "The first thing I did after reading your letter was to go
on my knees, and, out of a full heart, thank my dear God for this
mercy. Now I am again at peace, since I know that I need no
longer be concerned about the two persons who are the dearest
things on earth to me."</p>

<p id="id00501">(Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father, who had written that he and<br/>

Nannerl had comforted each other on the death of his mother.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00502">188. "Dearest, best of fathers! I wish you all conceivable good;
whatever can be wished, that I wish you,—but no, I wish you
nothing, but myself everything. For myself, then, I wish that you
remain well and live innumerable years to my great happiness and
pleasure; I wish that everything that I undertake may agree with
your desire and liking,—or, rather, that I may undertake nothing
which might not turn out to your joy. This also I hope, for
whatever adds to the happiness of your son must naturally be
agreeable also to you."</p>

<p id="id00503">(Vienna, November 16, 1781, to his father, congratulating him on
his name-day. On March 17, 1778, Mozart had written from
Mannheim: "Your accuracy extends to all things. 'Papa comes
directly after God' was my maxim as a child and I shall stick to
it.")</p>

<p id="id00504">189. "Our little cousin is pretty, sensible, amiable, clever and
merry, all because she has been in society; she visited Munich
for a while. You are right, we suit each other admirably, for
she, too, is a bit naughty. We play great pranks on the people
hereabouts."</p>

<p id="id00505">(Augsburg, October 17, 1777, to his father. The "little cousin"
was two years younger than Mozart. Her father was a master
bookbinder in Augsburg. The maiden seems later to have had
serious designs on the composer.)</p>

<p id="id00506">190. "I shall be right glad when I meet a place in which there is
a court. I tell you that if I did not have so fine a Mr. Cousin
and Miss Cousin and so dear a little cousin, my regrets that I am
in Augsburg would be as numerous as the hairs of my head."</p>

<p id="id00507">(Augsburg, October 17, 1777, to his father, whose birthplace he
was visiting on a concert tour. Mozart was vexed at the insolence
of the patricians.)</p>

<p id="id00508">191. "In the case of Frau Lange I was a fool,—that's certain;
but what is a fellow not when he's in love? I did really love
her, and am not indifferent toward her even now. It's lucky for
me that her husband is a jealous fool and never permits her to go
anywhere, so that I seldom see her."</p>

<p id="id00509">(Vienna, May 12, 1781, to his father, at the time when he was
being outrageously treated by the Archbishop. Frau Lange was
Aloysia Weber, sister of Constanze, to whom Mozart transferred
his love and whom he made his wife. Aloysia married an actor at
the Court Theatre, Josef Lange, with whom she lived unhappily.)</p>

<p id="id00510">192. "I will not say that when at the house of the Mademoiselle
to whom I seem already to have been married off, I am morose and
silent; but neither am I in love. I jest with her and amuse her
when I have time (which is only evenings when I sup at home, for
in the forenoons I write in my room and in the afternoons I am
seldom at home); only that and nothing more. If I were obliged to
marry all the girls with whom I have jested I should have at
least 200 wives."</p>

<p id="id00511">(Vienna, July 25, 1781, to his father, who had heard all manner
of tales concerning the relations of Mozart and Constanze Weber.)</p>

<p id="id00512">193. "My good, dear Constanze is the martyr, and, perhaps for
that very reason, the best hearted, cleverest, and (in a word)
the best of them all. She assumes all the cares of the house, and
yet does not seem able to accomplish anything. O, best of
fathers, I could write pages if I were to tell you all the scenes
that have taken place in this house because of us
two….Constanze is not ugly, but anything but beautiful; all her
beauty consists of two little black eyes and a handsome figure.
She is not witty but has enough common sense to be able to
perform her duties as wife and mother. She is not inclined to
finery,—that is utterly false; on the contrary, she is generally
ill clad, for the little that the mother was able to do for her
children was done for the other two—nothing for her. True she
likes to be neatly and cleanly, though not extravagantly,
dressed, and she can herself make most of the clothes that a
woman needs; she also dresses her own hair every day, understands
housekeeping, has the best heart in the world,—tell me, could I
wish a better wife?"</p>

<p id="id00513">(Vienna, December 15, 1781, to his father. Constanze seems to
have been made for Mozart; they went through the years of their
brief wedded life like two children.)</p>

<p id="id00514">194. "Dearest, best of friends!"</p>

<p id="id00515">"Surely you will let me call you that? You can not hate me so
greatly as not to permit me to be your friend, and yourself to
become mine? And even if you do not want to be my friend longer,
you can not forbid me to think kindly of you as I have been in
the habit of doing. Consider well what you said to me today.
Despite my entreaties you gave me the mitten three times and told
me to my face that you would have nothing further to do with me.
I, to whom it is not such a matter of indifference as it is to
you to lose a sweetheart, am not so hot tempered, inconsiderate
or unwise as to accept that mitten. I love you too dearly for
that. I therefore beg you to ponder on the cause of your
indignation. A little confession of your thoughtless conduct
would have made all well,—if you do not take it ill, dear friend,
may still make all well. From this you see how much I love you.
I do not flare up as you do; I think, I consider, and I feel. If
you have any feeling I am sure that I will be able to say to
myself before night: Constanze is the virtuous, honor-loving,
sensible and faithful sweetheart of just and well-meaning Mozart."</p>

<p id="id00516">(Vienna, April 29, 1782, to his fiancee, Constanze Weber. She had
played at a game of forfeits such as was looked upon lightly by
the frivolous society of the period in Vienna. Mozart rebuked her
and she broke off the engagement. The letter followed and soon
thereafter a reconciliation. Mozart had said to her: "No girl who
is jealous of her honor would do such a thing.")</p>

<p id="id00517">195. "She is an honest, good girl of decent parents;—I am able
to provide her with bread;—we love each other and want each
other!…It is better to put one's things to rights and be an
honest fellow!—God will give the reward! I do not want to have
anything to reproach myself with."</p>

<p id="id00518">(Vienna, July 31, 1782, to his father, who had given his consent,
hesitatingly and unwillingly, to the marriage of his son who was
twenty-six years old. On August 7 Mozart wrote to him: "I kiss
your hands and thank you with all the tenderness which a son
should feel for his father, for your kind permission and paternal
blessing.")</p>

<p id="id00519">196. "If I were to tell you all the things that I do with your
portrait, you would laugh heartily. For instance when I take it
out of its prison house I say 'God bless you, Stanzerl! God bless
you, you little rascal,—Krallerballer—Sharpnose—little
Bagatelle!' And when I put it back I let it slip down slowly and
gradually and say 'Nu,—Nu,—Nu,—Nu;' but with the emphasis
which this highly significant word demands, and at the last,
quickly: 'Good-night, little Mouse, sleep well!' Now, I suppose,
I have written down a lot of nonsense (at least so the world
would think); but for us, who love each other so tenderly, it
isn't altogether silly."</p>

<p id="id00520">(Dresden, April 13, 1789, to his wife in Vienna.)</p>

<p id="id00521">197. "Dear little wife, I have a multitude of requests;
1mo, I beg of you not to be sad.</p>

<p id="id00522">"2do, that you take care of your health and not trust the spring
air.</p>

<p id="id00523">"3tio, that you refrain from walking out alone, or, better, do
not walk out at all.</p>

<p id="id00524">"4to, that you rest assured of my love. Not a letter have I
written to you but that your portrait was placed in front of
mine.</p>

<p id="id00525">"5to, I beg of you to consider not only my honor and yours in
your conduct but also in appearances. Do not get angry because of
this request. You ought to love me all the more because I make so
much of honor."</p>

<p id="id00526">(Dresden, April 16, 1789, to his wife, in Vienna, who was fond of
life's pleasures.)</p>

<p id="id00527">198. "You can not imagine how slowly time goes when you are not
with me! I can't describe the feeling; there is a sort of sense
of emptiness, which hurts—a certain longing which can not be
satisfied, and hence never ends, but grows day by day. When I
remember how childishly merry we were in Baden, and what
mournful, tedious hours I pass here, my work gives me no
pleasure, because it is not possible as was my wont, to chat a
few words with you when stopping for a moment. If I go to the
Clavier and sing something from the opera (Die Zauberflote) I
must stop at once because of my emotions.—Basta!"</p>

<p id="id00528">(Vienna, July 7, 1791, to his wife, who was taking the waters at<br/>

Baden.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00529">199. "I call only him or her a friend who is a friend under all
circumstances, who thinks day or night of nothing else than to
promote the welfare of a friend, who urges all well-to-do friends
and works himself to make the other person happy."</p>

<p id="id00530">(Kaisersheim, December 18, 1778, to his father. Mozart was making
the journey from Mannheim to Munich in the carriage of a prelate.
The parting with his Mannheim friends, especially with Frau
Cannabich, his motherly friend, was hard. "For me, who never made
a more painful parting than this, the journey was only half
pleasant—it would even have been a bore, if from childhood I had
not been accustomed to leave people, countries and cities.")</p>

<p id="id00531">200. "Permit me to beg for a continuance of your precious
friendship, and to ask you to accept mine for now and forever;
with an honest heart I vow it to you everlastingly. True it will
be of little use to you; but it will be the more durable and
honest for that reason. You know that the best and truest friends
are the poor. Rich people know nothing of friendship!—especially
those who are born rich and those who have become rich
fortuitously,—they are too often wrapped up completely in their
own luck! But there is nothing to fear from a man who has been
placed in advantageous circumstances, not through blind, but
deserved good fortune, through merit,—a man who did not lose
courage because of his first failures,—who remained true to his
religion and trust in God, was a good Christian and an honest man
and cherished and valued his true friend,—in a word,—a man who
has deserved better fortune—from such a man, there is nothing to
fear."</p>

<h3 id="id00535" style="margin-top: 3em">WORLDLY WISDOM</h3>

<p id="id00536" style="margin-top: 3em">Mozart's father brought him up to be worldly wise. While
journeying at a tender age through the world with his father the
lad became an eye witness of the paternal business management
with all its attention to detail; of the art of utilizing persons
and conditions in order to achieve material results. As a youth
he repeats the journeys accompanied by his mother whom he loses
by death in Paris. Regularly from Salzburg his father sends him
letters full of admonitions and advice, the subjects almost
systematically grouped. The worldly wisdom of the son is the
fruit of paternal education, which he did not outgrow up to the
day of his death. But life, experience, was also an educator; a
seeming distrust of mankind speaks out of many a passage in his
letters, but on the whole he thought too well of his fellow men,
and remained blind to the faults of his false friends who basely
exploited him for their own ends. Although gifted with keen
powers of observation he always followed his kind heart instead
of his better judgment and his sister spoke no more than the
truth when she said after his death: "Outside of music he was,
and remained, nearly always, a child. This was the chief trait of
his character on its shady side; he always needed a father,
mother, or other guardian."</p>

<p id="id00537">202. "Reflect, too, on this only too certain truth: it is not
always wise to do all the things contemplated. Often one thinks
one thing would be most advisable and another unadvisable and
bad, when, if it were done, the opposite results would disclose
themselves."</p>

<p id="id00538">(Mannheim, December 10, 1777, to his father, when a plan for an
appointment in Mannheim came to naught.)</p>

<p id="id00539">203. "I am not indifferent but only resolved, and therefore, I
can endure everything with patience,—provided, only, that
neither my honor nor the good name of Mozart shall suffer
therefrom. Well, since it must be so, so be it; only I beg, do
not rejoice or sorrow prematurely; for let happen what may it
will be all right so long as we remain well—happiness exists
only in the imagination."</p>

<p id="id00540">(Mannheim, November 29, 1777, to his father, who had upbraided
him because of his reckless expenditures. At the time Mozart was
hoping for an appointment at Mannheim.)</p>

<p id="id00541">204. "Dearest and best of fathers:—You shall see that things go
better and better with me. What use is this perpetual turmoil,
this hurried fortune? It does not endure.—Che va piano va, sano.
One must adjust himself to circumstances."</p>

<p id="id00542">(Vienna, December 22, 1781, to his father, just before Mozart's
marriage engagement to Constanze Weber.)</p>

<p id="id00543">205. "Now, to put your mind at ease, I am doing nothing without
reasons, and well-founded ones, too."</p>

<p id="id00544">(Vienna, October 21, 1781, to his "little cousin," who may still
have cherished hopes of capturing her merry kinsman.)</p>

<p id="id00545">206. "I have no news except that 35, 59, 60, 61, 62, were the
winning numbers in the lottery, and, therefore, that if we had
played those numbers we would have won; but that inasmuch as we
did not play those numbers we neither won nor lost but had a good
laugh at others."</p>

<p id="id00546">(Milan, October 26, 1771, to his sister.)</p>

<p id="id00547">207. "Everybody was extremely courteous, and therefore I was also
very courteous; for it is my custom to conduct myself towards
others as they conduct themselves towards me,—it's the best way
to get along."</p>

<p id="id00548">(Augsburg, October 14, 1777, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00549">208. "In Vienna and all the imperial hereditaments the theatres
will all open in six weeks. It is wisely designed; for the dead
are not so much benefited by the long mourning as many people are
harmed."</p>

<p id="id00550">(Munich, December 13, 1780, to his father. Empress Maria Theresa
had died on November 29. Mozart had greatly revered her from his
youth. Nevertheless he takes a practical view of the situation
since the production of his opera "Idomeneo" is imminent. He
requests of his father to have his "black coat thoroughly dusted,
cleaned and put to rights," and to send it to him, since
"everybody would go into mourning, and I, who will be summoned
hither and thither, must weep along with the others.")</p>

<p id="id00551">209. "Rest assured that I am a changed man; outside of my health
I know of nothing more necessary than money. I am certainly not a
miser,—it would be difficult for me to change myself into one—and
yet the people here think me more disposed to be stingy than
prodigal; and for a beginning that will suffice. So far as pupils
are concerned I can have as many as I want; but I do not want many;
I want better pay than the others, and therefore I am content with
fewer. One must put on a few airs at the beginning or one is lost,
i.e. one must travel the common road with the many."</p>

<p id="id00552">(Vienna, May 26, 1781, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00553">210. "Depend confidently on me. I am no longer a fool, and you
will still less believe that I am a wicked and ungrateful son.
Meanwhile trust my brains and my good heart implicitly, and you
shall never be sorry. How should I have learned to value money? I
never had enough of it in my hands. I remember that once when I
had 20 ducats I thought myself rich. Need alone teaches the value
of money."</p>

<p id="id00554">(Vienna, May 26, 1781, to his father.)</p>

<p id="id00555">211. "If it were possible that it should vex me I should do my
best not to notice it; as it is, thank God, there is no need of
my deceiving myself because only the opposite could vex me, and I
should have had to decline, which is always too bad when one is
dealing with a grand gentleman."</p>

<p id="id00556">(Vienna, October 5, 1782, to his father. Mozart had expected to
give music lessons to a princess, but another teacher was chosen.
Continuing in the same letter, he says: "I need only tell you his
fee and you will easily be able to judge from it the strength of
the master—400 florins. His name is Summerer.")</p>

<p id="id00557">212. "I shall compose an opera but not in order, for the sake of
100 ducats, to see the theatre earn four times as much in a
fortnight. I shall perform my opera at my own cost and make at
least 1,200 florins in three performances; then the director can
have the work for 50 ducats. If he does not want it I shall have
received my pay and can utilize the opera elsewhere. I hope that
you have never observed a tendency to dishonest dealing in me.
One ought not to be a bad fellow, but neither ought one to be a
stupid who is willing to let others benefit from the work which
cost him study, care and labor, and surrender all claims for the
future."</p>

<p id="id00558">(Vienna, October 5, 1782, to his father. Mozart's plans for
exploiting his opera were never realized.)</p>

<p id="id00559">213. "Yesterday I dined with the Countess Thun, and tomorrow I
shall dine with her again. I let her hear all that was complete;
she told me that she would wager her life that everything that I
have written up to date would please. In such matters I care
nothing for the praise or censure of anybody until the whole work
has been seen or heard; instead I follow my own judgment and
feelings."</p>

<p id="id00560">(Vienna, August 8, 1781, to his father. The opera in question was<br/>

"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.")<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00561">214. "Magnanimity and gentleness have often reconciled the worst
enemies."</p>

<p id="id00562">(Vienna, July 8, 1791, to his wife, who had somewhat rudely
repulsed the advances of one of the visitors at Baden where she
was taking the waters.)</p>

<h3 id="id00563" style="margin-top: 3em">IN SUFFERING</h3>

<p id="id00564" style="margin-top: 3em">It is as difficult to call up in the fancy a picture of a
suffering Mozart as a merry Beethoven. The effect of melancholy
hours is scarcely to be found in Mozart's music. When he
composed,—i.e. according to his own expression "speculated"
while walking up and down revolving musical ideas in his mind and
forming them into orderly compositions, so that the subsequent
transcription was a mechanical occupation which required but
little effort,—he was transported to the realm of tones, far
from the miseries of this world. Nor would his happy disposition
permit him long to remain under the influence of grief and care.
None of the letters which sound notes of despair lacks a jest in
which the writer forcibly tears himself away from his gloomy
thoughts. His sufferings came to him from without; the fate of a
Beethoven was spared him. Others brought him pain,—his rivals
through envy, the Archbishop through malevolence, the Emperor
through ignorance. Sufferings of this character challenged
opposition and called out his powers, presenting to us a Mozart
full of temperament and capable of measuring himself with any
opponent.</p>

<p id="id00565">He never lost hope even when hope seemed most deceptive. It is
therefore impossible to speak of a suffering Mozart in the sense
that we speak of a suffering Beethoven; fate was kind even at his
death, which was preceded by but a brief illness.</p>

<p id="id00566">215. "I am still full of gall!…Three times this—I do not
know what to call him—has assailed me to my face with
impertinence and abuse of a kind that I did not want to write
down, my best of fathers, and I did not immediately avenge the
insult because I thought of you. He called me a wretch (Buben),
a licentious fellow, told me to get out and I—suffered it all,
feeling that not only my honor but yours as well was attacked;
but,—it was your wish,—I held my tongue."</p>

<p id="id00567">(Vienna, May 9, 1781, to his father, who had heard with deep
concern of the treatment which his son was enduring at the hands
of the Archbishop of Salzburg, and who feared for his own
position. At the close of the letter Mozart writes: "I want to
hear nothing more about Salzburg; I hate the archbishop to the
verge of madness.")</p>

<p id="id00568">216. "The edifying things which the Archbishop said to me in the
three audiences, particularly in the last, and what I have again
been told by this glorious man of God, had so admirable a
physical effect on me that I had to leave the opera in the
evening in the middle of the first act, go home, and to bed. I
was in a fever, my whole body trembled, and I reeled like a
drunken man in the street. The next day, yesterday, I remained at
home and all forenoon in bed because I had taken the tamarind
water."</p>

<p id="id00569">(Vienna, May 12, 1781, to his father. The catastrophe
between Mozart and the archbishop is approaching.)</p>

<p id="id00570">217. "Twice the Archbishop gave me the grossest impertinences and
I answered not a word; more, I played for him with the same zeal
as if nothing had happened. Instead of recognizing the honesty of
my service and my desire to please him at the moment when I was
expecting something very different, he begins a third tirade in
the most despicable manner in the world."</p>

<p id="id00571">(Vienna, June 13, 1781, to his father. See the chapter<br/>

"Self-Respect and Honor.")<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00572">218. "All the world asserts that by my braggadocio and criticisms
I have made enemies of the professional musicians! Which world?
Presumably that of Salzburg, for anybody living in Vienna sees
and hears differently; there is my answer."</p>

<p id="id00573">(Vienna, July 31, to his father, who had sent Mozart what the
latter called "so indifferent and cold a letter," when informed
by his son of the great success of his opera, "Die Entfuhrung aus
dem Serail." As on previous occasions Salzburg talebearers had
been busying themselves.)</p>

<p id="id00574">219. "I rejoice like a child at the prospect of being with you
again. I should have to be ashamed of myself if people could look
into my heart; so far as I am concerned it is cold,—cold as ice.
Yes, if you were with me I might find greater pleasure in the
courteous treatment which I receive from the people; but as it
is, it is all empty. Adieu!—Love!"</p>

<p id="id00575">(Frankfort, September 30, 1790, to his wife. Mozart had made the
journey to Frankfort to give concerts amidst the festivities
accompanying the coronation of Leopold II, hoping that he could
better his financial condition. Not having been sent at the cost
of the Emperor, like other Court musicians, he pawned his silver,
bought a carriage and took with him his brother-in-law, a
violinist named Hofer. "It took us only six days to make the
journey." He was disappointed in his expectations. "I have now
decided to do as well as I can here and look joyfully towards a
meeting with you. What a glorious life we shall lead; I shall
work—work!")</p>

<p id="id00576">220. "Dreams give me no concern, for there is no mortal man on
earth who does not sometimes dream. But merry dreams! quiet,

they were realities, would make tolerable my life which has more
of sadness in it than merriment."</p>

sojourn in Paris the love of Aloysia Weber had grown cold, and
Mozart was in the dolors.)</p>

stripped that I must beg you, dear friend, for God's sake to help
me out with what you can spare."</p>

myself?"</p>

<p id="id00589">(Said on the day of his death while still working on the
"Requiem" for which he had received so mysterious a commission.
The work had been ordered by a Count Walsegg, who made
pretensions to musical composition, and who wished to palm it off

knew him.)</p>

poisoned! I can not rid myself of this thought."</p>

<p id="id00591">(Mozart believed that he had been poisoned by one of his Italian
rivals, his suspicion falling most strongly on Salieri. ["As
regards Mozart, Salieri cannot escape censure, for though the
accusation of having been the cause of his death has been long
ago disproved, it is more than possible that he was not
displeased at the removal of so formidable a rival. At any rate,
though he had it in his power to influence the Emperor in
Mozart's favor, he not only neglected to do so, but even
intrigued against him as Mozart himself relates in a letter to
his friend Puchberg. After his death, however, Salieri befriended
his son, and gave him a testimonial which secured him his first
appointment." C.F. Pohl, in "Grove's Dictionary of Music and
Musicians."])</p>

<p id="id00592">228. "Stay with me to-night; you must see me die. I have long had

<p id="id00594">229. "And now I must go just as it had become possible for me to
live quietly. Now I must leave my art just as I had freed myself
from the slavery of fashion, had broken the bonds of speculators,
and won the privilege of following my own feelings and compose
freely and independently whatever my heart prompted! I must away
from my family, from my poor children in the moment when I should
have been able better to care for their welfare!"</p>

<p id="id00595">(Uttered on his death-bed.)</p>

<h3 id="id00596" style="margin-top: 3em">MORALS</h3>

<p id="id00597" style="margin-top: 3em">As regards his manner of life and morals Mozart long stood in a
bad light before the world. The slanderous stories all came from
his enemies in Vienna, and a long time passed before their true
character was recognized. A great contribution to this end was
made by the publication of his letters, which disclose an
extraordinarily strong moral sense. The tale of an alleged
liaison with a certain Frau Hofdamel, as a result of which the
deceived husband was said to have committed suicide, has been
proved to be wholly untrue and without warrant.</p>

<p id="id00598">It may be said, indeed, that Mozart was an exception among the
men of his period. The immorality of the Viennese was proverbial.
Karoline Pichler, a contemporary, writes as follows in her book
of recollections of the eighth decade of the eighteenth century:
"In Vienna at the time there reigned a spirit of appreciation for
merriment and a susceptibility for every form of beauty and
sensuous pleasure. There was the greatest freedom of thought and
opinion; anything could be written and printed which was not, in
the strictest sense of the words, contrary to religion and the
state. Little thought was bestowed on good morals. There was
considerable license in the current plays and novels. Kotzebue
created a tremendous sensation. His plays…and a multitude of
romances and tales (Meissner's sketches among other things) were
all based on meretricious relations. All the world and every
young girl read them without suspicion or offence. More than once
had I read and seen these things; 'Oberon' was well known to me;
so was Meissner's 'Alcibiades.' No mother hesitated to acquaint
her daughter with such works and before our eyes there were so
many living exemplars whose irregular conduct was notorious, that
no mother could have kept her daughter in ignorance had she
tried."</p>

<p id="id00599">Mozart was a passionate jester and his jokes were coarse enough;
of that there is no doubt. But these things were innocent at the
time. The letters of the lad to his little cousin in Augsburg
contain many passages that would be called of questionable
propriety now; but the little cousin does not seem to have even
blushed. The best witness to the morality of Mozart's life is his
wife, who, after his death, wrote to the publishing firm of
Breitkopf and Hartel: "His letters are beyond doubt the best
criterion for his mode of thought, his peculiarities and his
education. Admirably characteristic is his extraordinary love for
me, which breathes through all his letters. Those of his last
year on earth are just as tender as those which he must have
written in the first year of our married life;—is it not so? I
beg as a particular favor that special attention be called to
this fact for the sake of his honor."</p>

<p id="id00600">He was a Freemason with all his heart, and gave expression to his
humanitarian feeling in his opera "The Magic Flute." Without
suspicion himself, he thought everybody else good, which led to
painful experiences with some of his friends.</p>

<p id="id00601">230. "Parents strive to place their children in a position which
shall enable them to earn their own living; and this they owe to
their children and the state. The greater the talents with which
the children have been endowed by God, the more are they bound to
make use of those talents to improve the conditions of themselves
and their parents, to aid their parents and to care for their own
present and future welfare. We are taught thus to trade with our
talents in the Gospels. I owe it, therefore, to God and my
conscience to pay the highest gratitude to my father, who
tirelessly devoted all his hours to my education, and to lighten
his burdens."</p>

<p id="id00602">(From his request for dismissal from service in August, 1777. He
wished to undertake an artistic tour with his father. He received
his dismissal from the Archbishop of Salzburg, who granted it
right unwillingly, however.)</p>

<p id="id00603">231. "Only one thing vexed me a trifle,—the question whether I
had forgotten confession. I have no complaint to make, but I do
ask one favor, and that is that you do not think so ill of me!
I am fond of merriment, but, believe me, I can also be serious.
Since I left Salzburg (and while still in Salzburg) I have met
persons whose conduct was such that I would have been ashamed to
talk and act as they did though they were ten, twenty or thirty
years older than I! Again I humbly beg of you to have a better
opinion of me."</p>

<p id="id00604">(Mannheim, December 30, 1777, to his father, in answer to a
letter of reproaches.)</p>

<p id="id00605">232. "With all my heart I do wish Herr von Schiedenhofen joy. It
is another marriage for money and nothing else. I should not like
to marry thus; I want to make my wife happy,—not have her make
my fortune. For that reason I shall not marry but enjoy my golden
freedom until I am so situated that I can support wife and
children. It was necessary that Herr Sch. should marry a rich
woman; that's the consequence of being a nobleman. The nobility
must never marry from inclination or love, but only from
considerations of interest, and all manner of side
considerations. Nor would it be becoming in such persons if they
were still to love their wives after the latter had done their
duty and brought forth a plump heir."</p>

<p id="id00606">(Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father.)</p>

unbecoming to a Christian and an honest man). I am anticipating
the pleasantest and happiest days, but only in company with you

endure Salzburg and its citizens (I speak of the natives). Their

not give me the least concern. The people may write the eyes out

<p id="id00615">237. "Dearest and best of fathers:—I beg of you, for the sake of
all that is good in the world, give your consent to my marriage
with my dear Constanze. Do not think that it is alone because of
my desire to get married; I could well wait. But I see that it is
absolutely essential to my honor, the honor of my sweetheart, to
my health and frame of mind. My heart is ill at ease, my mind
disturbed;—then how shall I do any sensible thinking or work?
Why is this? Most people think we are already married; this
enrages the mother and the poor girl and I are tormented almost
to death. All this can be easily relieved. Believe me it is
possible to live as cheaply in expensive Vienna as anywhere else;
it all depends on the housekeeping and the orderliness which is
never to be found in a young man especially if he be in love.
Whoever gets a wife such as I am going to have can count himself
fortunate. We shall live simply and quietly, and yet be happy.
Do not worry; for should I (which God forefend!) get ill today,
especially if I were married, I wager that the first of the
nobility would come to my help….I await your consent with
longing, best of fathers, I await it with confidence, my honor
and fame depend upon it."</p>

<p id="id00617">238. "Meanwhile my striving is to secure a small certainty; then
with the help of the contingencies, it will be easy to live here;
and then to marry. I beg of you, dearest and best of fathers,
listen to me! I have preferred my request, now listen to my
reasons. The calls of nature are as strong in me, perhaps
stronger, than in many a hulking fellow. I can not possibly live
like the majority of our young men. In the first place I have too
much religion, in the second too much love for my fellow man and
too great a sense of honor ever to betray a girl…."</p>

<p id="id00618">(Vienna, December 18, 1781. [The whole of this letter deserves to
be read by those who, misled by the reports, still deemed
trustworthy when Jahn published the first edition of his great
biography, believed that Mozart was a man of bad morals.
Unfortunately Mozart's candor in presenting his case to his
father can scarcely be adjusted to the requirements of a book
designed for general circulation. Let it suffice that in his
confession to his father Mozart puts himself on the ground of the
loftiest sexual purity, and stakes life and death on the
truthfulness of his statements. H.E.K.])</p>

<p id="id00619">239. "You surely can not be angry because I want to get married?
I think and believe that you will recognize best my piety and
honorable intentions in the circumstance. O, I could easily write
a long answer to your last letter, and offer many objections; but
my maxim is that it is not worth while to discuss matters that
do not affect me. I can't help it,—it's my nature. I am really
ashamed to defend myself when I find myself falsely accused;
I always think, the truth will out some day."</p>

<p id="id00620">(Vienna, January 9, 1782, to his father. In the same letter he
continues: "I can not be happy and contented without my dear
Constanze, and without your satisfied acquiescence, I could only
be half happy. Therefore, make me wholly happy.")</p>

<p id="id00621">240. "As I have thought and said a thousand times I would gladly
leave everything in your hands with the greatest pleasure, but
since, so to speak, it is useless to you but to my advantage, I
deem it my duty to remember my wife and children."</p>

<p id="id00622">(June 16, 1787, to his sister, concerning his inheritance from
his father who had died on May 28.)</p>

<p id="id00623">241. "Isn't it true that you are daily becoming more convinced of
the truth of my corrective sermons? Is not the amusement of a
fickle and capricious love far as the heavens from the
blessedness which true, sensible love brings with it? Do you not
often thank me in your heart for my instruction? You will soon
make me vain! But joking aside, you do owe me a modicum of
gratitude if you have made yourself worthy of Fraulein N., for I
certainly did not play the smallest role at your conversion."</p>

<p id="id00624">(Prague, November 4, 1787, to a wealthy young friend, name
unknown.)</p>

<p id="id00625">242. "Pray believe anything you please about me but nothing ill.
There are persons who believe it is impossible to love a poor
girl without harboring wicked intentions; and the beautiful word
mistress is so lovely!—I am a Mozart, but a young and well
meaning Mozart. Among many faults I have this that I think that
the friends who know me, know me. Hence many words are not
necessary. If they do not know me where shall I find words
enough? It is bad enough that words and letters are necessary."</p>

<p id="id00626">(Mannheim, February 22, 1778, to his father, who had rebuked him
for falling in love with Aloysia Weber, who afterward became his
sister-in-law.)</p>

<h3 id="id00627" style="margin-top: 3em">RELIGION</h3>

<p id="id00628" style="margin-top: 3em">Mozart was of a deeply religious nature, reared in Salzburg where
his father was a member of the archiepiscopal chapel. Throughout
his life he remained a faithful son of the church, for whose
servants, however, he had little sympathy.</p>

<p id="id00629">The one man whom Mozart hated from the bottom of his soul was
Archbishop Hieronymus of Salzburg who sought to put all possible
obstacles in the way of the youthful genius, and finally by the
most infamous of acts covered himself everlastingly with infamy.
Though Mozart frequently speaks angrily and bitterly of the
priests he always differentiates between religion, the church and
their servants. Like Beethoven, Mozart stood toward God in the
relationship of a child full of trust in his father.</p>

<p id="id00630">His reliance on Providence was so utter that his words sometimes
sound almost fatalistic. His father harbored some rationalistic
ideas which were even more pronounced in Mozart, so that he
formed his own opinion concerning ecclesiastical ceremonies and
occasionally disregarded them. His cheery temperament made it
impossible that his religious life should be as profound as that
of Beethoven.</p>

<p id="id00631" style="margin-top: 3em">243. "I hope that with the help of God, Miss Martha will get well
again. If not, you should not grieve too deeply, for God's will
is always the best. God will know whether it is better to be in
this world or the other."</p>

<p id="id00632">(Bologna, September 29, 1770, to his mother and sister in<br/>

Salzburg. The young woman died soon after.)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00633">244. "Tell papa to put aside his fears; I live, with God ever
before me. I recognize His omnipotence, I fear His anger; I
acknowledge His love, too, His compassion and mercy towards all
His creatures, He will never desert those who serve Him. If
matters go according to His will they go according to mine;
consequently nothing can go wrong,—I must be satisfied and
happy."</p>

<p id="id00634">(Augsburg, October 25, 1777, to his father, who was showering him
with exhortations on the tour which he made with his mother
through South Germany.)</p>

<p id="id00635">245. "Let come what will, nothing can go ill so long as it is the
will of God; and that it may so go is my daily prayer."</p>

<p id="id00636">(Mannheim, December 6, 1777, to his father. Mozart was waiting
with some impatience to learn if he was to receive an appointment
from Elector Karl Theodore. It did not come.)</p>

<p id="id00637">246. "I know myself;—I know that I have so much religion that I
shall never be able to do a thing which I would not be willing
openly to do before the whole world; only the thought of meeting
persons on my journeys whose ideas are radically different from
mine (and those of all honest people) frightens me. Aside from
that they may do what they please. I haven't the heart to travel
with them, I would not have a single pleasant hour, I would not
know what to say to them; in a word I do not trust them. Friends
who have no religion are not stable."</p>

<p id="id00638">(Mannheim, February 2, 1778, to his father. For the reasons
mentioned in the letter Mozart gave up his plan to travel to
Paris with the musicians Wendling and Ramen. In truth, perhaps,
his love affair with Aloysia Weber may have had something to do
with his resolve.)</p>

<p id="id00639">247. "I prayed to God for His mercy that all might go well, to
His greater glory, and the symphony began….Immediately after
the symphony full of joy I went into the Palais Royal, ate an
iced cream, prayed the rosary as I had promised to do, and went
home. I am always best contented at home and always will be, or
with a good, true, honest German."</p>

<p id="id00640">(Paris, July 3, 1778, to his father. The symphony in question is
no longer in existence, although Mozart wanted to write it down
again at a later date.)</p>

<p id="id00641">248. "I must tell you my mother, my dear mother, is no more.—God
has called her to Himself; He wanted her, I see that clearly, and
I must submit to God's will. He gave her to me, and it was His to
take her away. My friend, I am comforted, not but now, but long
ago. By a singular grace of God I endured all with steadfastness
and composure. When her illness grew dangerous I prayed God for
two things only,—a happy hour of death for my mother, and
strength and courage for myself. God heard me in His loving
kindness, heard my prayer and bestowed the two mercies in largest
measure."</p>

<p id="id00642">(Paris, July 3, 1778, to his good friend Bullinger, in Salzburg,
who was commissioned gently to bear the intelligence to Mozart's
father. At the same time Mozart, with considerate deception,
wrote to his father about his mother's illness without mentioning
her death.)</p>

<p id="id00643">249. "I believe, and nothing shall ever persuade me differently,
that no doctor, no man, no accident, can either give life to man
or take it away; it rests with God alone. Those are only the
instruments which He generally uses, though not always; we see
men sink down and fall over dead. When the time is come no
remedies can avail,—they accelerate death rather than retard
it….I do not say, therefore, that my mother will and must die,
that all hope is gone; she may recover and again be well and
sound,—but only if it is God's will."</p>

<p id="id00644">(Paris, July 3, 1778, to his father, from whom he is concealing
the fact that his mother is dead. He is seeking to prepare him
for the intelligence which he has already commissioned Bullinger
to convey to the family.)</p>

<p id="id00645">250. "Under those melancholy circumstances I comforted myself
with three things, viz.: my complete and trustful submission to
the will of God, then the realization of her easy and beautiful
death, combined with the thought of the happiness which was to
come to her in a moment,—how much happier she now is than we, so
that we might even have wished to make the journey with her. Out
of this wish and desire there was developed my third comfort,
namely, that she is not lost to us forever, that we shall see her
again, that we shall be together more joyous and happy than ever
we were in this world. It is only the time that is unknown, and
that fact does not frighten me. When it is God's will, it shall
be mine. Only the divine, the most sacred will be done; let us
then pray a devout 'Our Father' for her soul and proceed to other
matters; everything has its time."</p>

<p id="id00646">(Paris, July 9, 1778, to his father, informing him of his
mother's death.)</p>

<p id="id00647">251. "Be without concern touching my soul's welfare, best of
fathers! I am an erring young man, like so many others, but I can
say to my own comfort, that I wish all were as little erring as
I. You, perhaps, believe things about me which are not true. My
chief fault is that I do not always appear to act as I ought. It
is not true that I boasted that I eat fish every fast-day; but I
did say that I was indifferent on the subject and did not
consider it a sin, for in my case fasting means breaking off,
eating less than usual. I hear mass every Sunday and holy day,
and when it is possible on week days also,—you know that, my
father."</p>

<p id="id00648">(Vienna, June 13, 1781—another attempt at justification against
slander.)</p>

<p id="id00649">252. "Moreover take the assurance that I certainly am religious,
and if I should ever have the misfortune (which God will
forefend) to go astray, I shall acquit you, best of fathers, from
all blame. I alone would be the scoundrel; to you I owe all my
spiritual and temporal welfare and salvation."</p>

<p id="id00650">(Vienna, June 13, 1781.)</p>

<p id="id00651">253. "For a considerable time before we were married we went
together to Holy Mass, to confession and to communion; and I
found that I never prayed so fervently, confessed and
communicated so devoutly, as when I was at her side;—and her
experience was the same. In a word we were made for each other,
and God, who ordains all things and consequently has ordained
this, will not desert us. We both thank you obediently for your
paternal blessing."</p>

<p id="id00652">(Vienna, August 17, 1782.)</p>

<p id="id00653">254. "I have made it a habit in all things to imagine the worst.
Inasmuch as, strictly speaking, death is the real aim of our
life, I have for the past few years made myself acquainted with
this true, best friend of mankind, so that the vision not only
has no terror for me but much that is quieting and comforting.
And I thank my God that He gave me the happiness and the
opportunity (you understand me) to learn to know Him as the key
to true blessedness."</p>

<p id="id00654">(Vienna, April 4, 1787, to his father, who died on the 28th of
the following month. One of the few passages in Mozart's letters
in which there are suggestions of the teachings of Freemasonry.
In 1785 he had persuaded his father to join the order, with the
result that new warmth was restored to the relationship which had
cooled somewhat after Mozart's marriage.)</p>

<p id="id00655">255. "To me that again is art twaddle! There may be something
true in it for you enlightened Protestants, as you call
yourselves, when you have your religion in your heads; I can not
tell. But you do not feel what 'Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata
mundi' and such things mean. But when one, like I, has been
initiated from earliest childhood in the mystical sanctuary of
our religion; when there one does not know whither to go with all
the vague but urgent feelings, but waits with a heart full of
devotion for the divine service without really knowing what to
expect, yet rises lightened and uplifted without knowing what one
has received; when one deemed those fortunate who knelt under the
touching strains of the Agnus Dei and received the sacrament, and
at the moment of reception the music spoke in gentle joy from the
hearts of the kneeling ones, 'Benedictus qui venit,' etc.;—then
it is a different matter. True, it is lost in the hurly-burly of
life; but,—at least it is so in my case,—when you take up the
words which you have heard a thousand times, for the purpose of
setting them to music, everything comes back and you feel your
soul moved again."</p>

<p id="id00656">(Spoken in Leipsic, in 1789, when somebody expressed pity for
those capable musicians who were obliged to "employ their powers
on ecclesiastical subjects, which were mostly not only unfruitful
but intellectually killing." Rochlitz reports the utterance but
does not vouch for its literalness.)</p>
