<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">In the valley of the Pegnitz, where across broad meadow-lands<br/></span> <span class="i0">Rise the blue Franconian mountains, Nuremberg, the ancient, stands.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Quaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art and song,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Memories haunt thy pointed gables, like the rooks that round them throng:<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Memories of the Middle Ages, when the emperors, rough and bold,<span class="linenum">5</span><br/></span> <span class="i0">Had their dwelling in thy castle, time-defying, centuries old;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted, in their uncouth rhyme,<br/></span> <span class="i0">That their great imperial city stretched its hand through every clime.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">In the court-yard of the castle, bound with many an iron band,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Stands the mighty linden planted by Queen Cunigunde's hand;<span class="linenum">10</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">On the square the oriel window, where in old heroic days<br/></span><a id="Page_104" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 104]"></a> <span class="i0">Sat the poet Melchior singing Kaiser Maximilian's praise.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Everywhere I see around me rise the wondrous world of Art:<br/></span> <span class="i0">Fountains wrought with richest sculpture standing in the common mart;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And above cathedral doorways saints and bishops carved in stone,<span class="linenum">15</span><br/></span> <span class="i0">By a former age commissioned as apostles to our own.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">In the church of sainted Sebald sleeps enshrined his holy dust,<br/></span> <span class="i0">And in bronze the Twelve Apostles guard from age to age their trust;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">In the church of sainted Lawrence stands a pix of sculpture rare,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Like the foamy sheaf of fountains, rising through the painted air.<span class="linenum">20</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Here, when Art was still religion, with a simple, reverent heart,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Lived and laboured Albrecht Dürer, the Evangelist of Art;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Hence in silence and in sorrow, toiling still with busy hand,<br/></span><a id="Page_105" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 105]"></a> <span class="i0">Like an emigrant he wandered, seeking for the Better Land.<br/></span></div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Fairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair,<br/></span> <span class="i0">That he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air!<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Through these streets so broad and stately, these obscure and dismal lanes,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Walked of yore the Master-singers, chanting rude poetic strains.<span class="linenum">30</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">From remote and sunless suburbs came they to the friendly guild,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Building nests in Fame's great temple, as in spouts the swallows build.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">As the weaver plied the shuttle, wove he too the mystic rhyme,<br/></span> <span class="i0">And the smith his iron measures hammered to the anvil's chime;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Thanking God, whose boundless wisdom makes the flowers of poesy bloom<span class="linenum">35</span><br/></span><a id="Page_106" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 106]"></a> <span class="i0">In the forge's dust and cinders, in the tissues of the loom.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Here Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, laureate of the gentle craft,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Wisest of the Twelve Wise Masters, in huge folios sang and laughed.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">But his house is now an ale-house, with a nicely sanded floor,<br/></span> <span class="i0">And a garland in the window, and his face above the door;<span class="linenum">40</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Painted by some humble artist, as in Adam Puschman's song,<br/></span> <span class="i0">As the old man grey and dove-like, with his great beard white and long.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And at night the swart mechanic comes to drown his cark and care,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Quaffing ale from pewter tankards, in the master's antique chair.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Vanished is the ancient splendour, and before my dreamy eye<span class="linenum">45</span><br/></span> <span class="i0">Wave these mingled shapes and figures, like a faded tapestry.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Not thy Councils, not thy Kaisers, win for thee the world's regard;<br/></span><a id="Page_107" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 107]"></a> <span class="i0">But thy painter, Albrecht Dürer, and Hans Sachs thy cobbler-bard.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Thus, O Nuremberg, a wanderer from a region far away,<br/></span> <span class="i0">As he paced thy streets and court-yards, sang in thought his careless lay:<span class="linenum">50</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Gathering from the pavement's crevice, as a floweret of the soil,<br/></span> <span class="i0">The nobility of labour,—the long pedigree of toil.<br/></span></div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">In the market-place of Bruges stands the belfry old and brown;<br/></span> <span class="i0">Thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded, still it watches o'er the town.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">As the summer morn was breaking, on that lofty tower I stood,<br/></span><a id="Page_109" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 109]"></a> <span class="i0">And the world threw off the darkness, like the weeds of widowhood.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Thick with towns and hamlets studded, and with streams and vapours gray,<span class="linenum">5</span><br/></span> <span class="i0">Like a shield embossed with silver, round and vast the landscape lay.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">At my feet the city slumbered. From its chimneys, here and there,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Wreaths of snow-white smoke ascending, vanished, ghost-like, into air.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Not a sound rose from the city at that early morning hour,<br/></span> <span class="i0">But I heard a heart of iron beating in the ancient tower.<span class="linenum">10</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">From their nests beneath the rafters sang the swallows wild and high;<br/></span> <span class="i0">And the world, beneath me sleeping, seemed more distant than the sky.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Then most musical and solemn, bringing back the olden times,<br/></span> <span class="i0">With their strange unearthly changes rang the melancholy chimes,<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Like the psalms from some old cloister, when the nuns sing in the choir;<span class="linenum">15</span><br/></span><a id="Page_110" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 110]"></a> <span class="i0">And the great bell tolled among them, like the chanting of a friar.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Visions of the days departed, shadowy phantoms filled my brain;<br/></span> <span class="i0">They who live in history only seemed to walk the earth again;<br/></span></div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">I beheld the pageants splendid that adorned those days of old;<br/></span> <span class="i0">Stately dames, like queens attended, knights who bore the Fleece of Gold.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Lombard and Venetian merchants with deep-laden argosies;<br/></span> <span class="i0">Ministers from twenty nations; more than royal pomp and ease.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">I beheld proud Maximilian, kneeling humbly on the ground;<span class="linenum">25</span><br/></span> <span class="i0">I beheld the gentle Mary, hunting with her hawk and hound;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And her lighted bridal-chamber, where a duke slept with the queen,<br/></span><a id="Page_111" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 111]"></a> <span class="i0">And the armèd guard around them, and the sword unsheathed between.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">I beheld the Flemish weavers, with Namur and Juliers bold,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Marching homeward from the bloody battle of the Spurs of Gold;<span class="linenum">30</span><br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Saw the fight at Minnewater, saw the White Hoods moving west,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Saw great Artevelde victorious scale the Golden Dragon's nest.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And again the whiskered Spaniard all the land with terror smote;<br/></span> <span class="i0">And again the wild alarum sounded from the tocsin's throat;<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Till the bell of Ghent responded o'er lagoon and dike of sand,<span class="linenum">35</span><br/></span> <span class="i0">'I am Roland! I am Roland! there is victory in the land!'<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Then the sound of drums aroused me. The awakened city's roar<br/></span> <span class="i0">Chased the phantoms I had summoned back into their graves once more.<br/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Hours had passed away like minutes; and, before I was aware,<br/></span> <span class="i0">Lo! the shadow of the belfry crossed the sun-illumined square.<span class="linenum">40</span><br/></span><a id="Page_112" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 112]"></a></div>

<p>The difficulty has been to select from a wealth of poems with which volumes could have been filled. Indeed three collections dealing exclusively with Greece, with Italy, and with Switzerland have already been published by the Oxford University Press. In this volume the traveller is not confined to one country, and he is not asked to drag a lengthening chain beyond the limits of Europe. Here are some poems about travel generally, and then country by country a grand tour is traced. My obligation to the authors or owners of copyright poems is duly acknowledged with grateful thanks.</p>
