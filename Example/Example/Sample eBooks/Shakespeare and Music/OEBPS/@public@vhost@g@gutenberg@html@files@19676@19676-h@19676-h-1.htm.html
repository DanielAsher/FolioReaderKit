<p><i>Jul.</i> Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i> That I might <i>sing</i> it, madam, to a <i>tune</i>:<br/>
<span class="c10"><i>Give me a note</i>: your ladyship can <i>set</i>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> As little by such toys as may be possible:<br/>
<span class="c10">Best sing it to the tune of "Light o' love."</span><br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i> It is too heavy for so <i>light</i> a tune.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> <i>Heavy?</i> belike, it hath some <i>burden</i> then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i> Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> And why not you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i><span class="c11">I cannot <i>reach so high</i>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> Let's see your song.—How now, minion!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i> <i>Keep tune</i> there still, so you will <i>sing it out</i>;<br/>
<span class="c10">And yet, methinks, I do not like this tune.</span><br/>
<br/>
<a id="Page_27" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 27]"></a><i>Jul.</i> You do not?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i><span class="c12">No, madam, it is <i>too sharp</i>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> You, minion, are too saucy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i><span class="c13">Nay, now you are <i>too flat</i>,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">And <i>mar the concord</i> with <i>too harsh a descant</i>:</span><br/>
<span class="c10">There wanteth but a <i>mean</i> to fill your song.</span><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> The <i>mean</i> is <i>drown'd</i> with your <i>unruly base</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luc.</i> Indeed, I bid the <i>base</i> for Proteus.<br/></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps it is sufficient to remark that many of the italicized words above are still in ordinary use by musicians—<i>e.g.</i>, to 'give the note' in order to 'set' the pitch for singing; to 'keep in tune,' to 'sing out'; or one voice is 'drowned' by another, as the 'mean' (alto) by the 'bass.' Once more we have quibbles on musical terms—Lucetta says the 'tune,' <i>i.e.</i>, Julia's testiness about Proteus' letter, is 'too sharp,' and that her chiding of herself is 'too flat,' meaning, that neither is in 'concord' with the spirit of the love-letter. Lucetta recommends the middle course, or 'mean' (alto voice, midway between treble and bass), 'to <i>fill</i> the song,' <i>i.e.</i>, to perfect the harmony. Finally, there is a punning reference (somewhat prophetic) by Lucetta, to the 'base' conduct of Proteus, in forsaking Julia for Silvia. Another play upon words should not be missed, viz., in ll. 78 and 79, where 'set' does double duty.</p>
<p><i>Rom.</i> III, v, 25. Romeo and Juliet's parting at day<a id="Page_28" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 28]"></a>break. The lark's song suggests musical metaphors in Juliet's speech.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Romeo.</i> How is't, my soul? let's talk, it is not day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Jul.</i> It is, it is; hie hence, be gone, away!<br/>
<span class="c10">It is the <i>lark</i> that sings so <i>out of tune</i>,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Straining <i>harsh discords</i>, and unpleasing <i>sharps</i>.</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Some say, the lark makes <i>sweet division</i>;</span><br/>
<span class="c10"><i>This</i> doth not so, for she <i>divideth us</i>.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>Juliet evidently agrees with Portia that 'nothing is good without respect.' The lark heralds the dawn, so Romeo must leave her, <i>ergo</i>, the lark sings 'out of tune,' his strains are full of 'discords' and 'sharps.' The last two lines contain an interesting allusion in the word 'division,' besides the pun on 'she <i>divideth us</i>.'</p>
<p>'Division' means roughly, a brilliant passage, of short notes, which is founded essentially on a much simpler passage of longer notes. A cant term for the old-fashioned variation (<i>e.g.</i>, the variations of the 'Harmonious Blacksmith') was 'Note-splitting,' which at once explains itself, and the older word 'Division.' A very clear example of Divisions may be found in 'Rejoice greatly' in the Messiah. The long 'runs' on the second syllable of '<i>Rejoice</i>,' consisting of several groups of four semiquavers, are simply 'division' or 'note-splittings' of the first note of each group.<a id="Page_29" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 29]"></a></p>
<p>The word, however, has a further use, namely, to play 'divisions' on a viol-da-gamba. This was a favourite accomplishment of gentlemen in the 16th and 17th centuries. Sir Andrew Aguecheek numbered this amongst his attainments, (see <i>Twelfth Night</i> I, iii, 24); and readers of John Inglesant will remember that 'Mr Inglesant, being pressed to oblige the company, played a descant upon a ground bass in the Italian manner.' Playing a descant on a ground bass meant playing extempore 'divisions' or variations, to the harmony of a 'ground bass' which (with its proper chords) was repeated again and again by the harpsichordist, until the viol player had exhausted his capacity to produce further 'breakings' of the harmony.</p>
<p>In 1665 there was published an instruction book in this art, called Chelys Minuritionum, <i>i.e.</i>, the 'Tortoise-shell of Diminutions,' hence (Chelys meaning a lyre, made of a tortoise-shell) 'The Division Viol.' The book is by Christopher Sympson, a Royalist soldier, who was a well-known viol-da-gamba player. The work is in three parts, the third of which is devoted to the method of ordering division on a ground.</p>
<p>To give his own words<a id="Page_30" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 30]"></a>—</p>
<p>'Diminution or division to a ground, is the breaking either of the bass or of any higher part that is applicable thereto. The manner of expressing it is thus:—</p>
<p>'A ground, subject, or bass, call it what you please, is prick'd down in two several papers; one for him who is to play the ground upon an organ, harpsichord, or what other instrument may be apt for that purpose; the other for him that plays upon the viol, who having the said ground before his eyes as his theme or subject, plays such variety of descant or division in concordance thereto as his skill and present invention do then suggest unto him.'</p>
<p>[See the <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a> for an example by Sympson.]</p>
<p>Further on, he distinguishes between 'breaking the notes of the <i>ground</i>' and 'descanting upon' the ground.</p>
<p>This phrase, 'breaking' notes, may be taken as a partial explanation of several passages on Shakespeare, where 'broken music' is referred to, although it is likely that a better account of this may be found in the natural imperfection of the Lute, which, being a <i>pizzicato</i> instrument (<i>i.e.</i>, the strings were plucked, not played with a bow), could not do more than indicate the harmony in 'broken' pieces, first a bass<a id="Page_31" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 31]"></a> note, then perhaps two notes at once, higher up in the scale, the player relying on the hearer to piece the harmony together.</p>
<p>An entirely different explanation is that of Mr Chappell (in Aldis Wright's Clarendon Press Edition of Henry V.), viz., that when a 'consort' of viols was imperfect, <i>i.e.</i>, if one of the players was absent, and an instrument of another kind, <i>e.g.</i>, a flute, was substituted, the music was thus said to be 'broken.' <i>Cf.</i> Matt. Locke's 'Compositions for Broken and Whole Consorts,' 1672.</p>
<p>[Mr Aldis Wright has given me references to Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum, III., 278, and Essay of Masque and Triumph, which show that 'Broken Music' was understood to mean <i>any combination of instruments of different kinds</i>. In Sylva Sylvarum Bacon mentions several 'consorts of Instruments' which agree well together, <i>e.g.</i>, 'the Irish Harp and Base-Viol agree well: the Recorder and Stringed Music agree well: Organs and the Voice agree well, etc. But the Virginals and the Lute ... agree not so well.' All these, and similar combinations, seem to have been described as 'Broken Music.']</p>
<p>In point, see <i>Hen. V.</i> V, ii, 248, where Henry proposes to Katherine.<a id="Page_32" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 32]"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Come, your answer in <i>broken music</i>; for thy <i>voice is music</i>, and thy <i>English broken</i>; therefore, queen of all, Katherine, <i>break</i> thy mind to me in <i>broken</i> English: wilt thou have me?</p>
</div>
<p>Also see <i>Troilus</i> III, i, 52 and ff. (quoted further on).</p>
<p>An entirely separate use of 'break' is in the phrase 'broken time,' which has the simple and obvious meaning that the notes do not receive their due length and proportion. In this connection we will take the passage of King Richard's speech in prison at Pontefract—when he hears music without, performed by some friendly hands.</p>
<p><i>Rich. II.</i> V, v, 41. King R. in prison.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>K. Rich.</i><span class="c14"><i>Music</i> do I hear?</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Ha, ha! <i>keep time</i>.—How sour sweet music is,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">When <i>time is broke</i>, and no <i>proportion kept</i>!</span><br/>
<span class="c10">So is it in the music of men's lives.</span><br/>
<span class="c10">And here have I the <i>daintiness of ear</i>,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">To check <i>time broke</i> in a <i>disorder'd string</i>;</span><br/>
<span class="c10">But, for the <i>concord</i> of <i>my</i> state and <i>time</i>,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Had not an <i>ear</i> to hear my true <i>time broke</i>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c14">* * * * *</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c10"><i>This music mads me</i>: let it sound no more:</span><br/>
<span class="c10">For though <i>it hath holp madmen</i> to their wits,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">In me, it seems, it will make wise men mad.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p><a id="Page_33" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 33]"></a>The simile is perfect, and the play upon 'time broke' admirable. In l. 45 Richard reflects on the sad contrast between his quick 'ear' for 'broken time' in music, and his slowness to hear the 'breaking' of his <i>own</i> 'state and time.' The 'disorder'd string' is himself, who has been playing his part 'out of time' ('Disorder'd' simply means 'out of its place'—<i>i.e.</i>, as we now say, 'a bar wrong'), and this has resulted in breaking the 'concord'—<i>i.e.</i>, the harmony of the various parts which compose the state.</p>
<p>A few words are necessary about 'Proportion.' This term was used in Elizabethan times exactly as we now use 'Time.' The 'times' used in modern music can practically be reduced to two—viz., Duple (two beats to the bar) and Triple (three beats to the bar). But in Elizabeth's day the table of various Proportions was a terribly elaborate thing. Of course many of these 'Proportions' never really came into practical use—but there was plenty of mystery left even after all deductions.</p>
<p>Morley (Introduction, 1597) gives Five kinds of proportions 'in most common use'—viz., Dupla, Tripla, Quadrupla, Sesquialtera, and Sesquitertia. The first three correspond to what we still call<a id="Page_34" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 34]"></a> Duple, Triple, and Quadruple Time—<i>i.e.</i>, 2 in the bar, 3 in the bar, and 4 in the bar. ['Bars' were not in general use till the end of the 16th century, but the principle was the same. The bars themselves are merely a convenience.]</p>
<p>Sesquialtera is more complicated, and means 'three notes are sung to two of the same kinde'; and 'Sesquitertia is when four notes are sung to three of the same kinde.' 'But' (Morley adds), 'if a man would ingulphe himselfe to learn to sing, and set down all them which Franchinus Gaufurius [1496] hath set down in his booke De Proportionibus Musicis, he should find it a matter not only hard but almost impossible.'</p>
<p>Ornithoparcus, in his Micrologus (1535), gives us an idea of the way this subject of proportion was treated by more 'learned' writers. He says (1) that music considers only the proportion of inequality, (2) that this is two-fold—viz., the greater and the lesser inequality. (3) The greater inequality contains five proportions, namely, multiplex, superparticular, superpartiens, multiplex superparticular, and multiplex superpartiens.</p>
<p>This is more amusing than instructive, perhaps. The three last lines of this passage refer to the<a id="Page_35" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 35]"></a> various stories of real or pretended cure of disease by the use of particular pieces of music. One of the best known of these diseases is 'Tarantism,' or the frenzy produced by the bite of the Tarantula, in Italy.</p>
<p>Kircher, a learned Jesuit (1601-1680), gives an account, in his "Musurgia," of the cure of this madness by certain airs, by which the patient is stimulated to dance violently. The perspiration thus produced was said to effect a cure. In his "Phonurgia nova" (1673) Kircher actually gives the notes of the tune by which one case was cured.</p>
<p>In this connection, Kircher mentions King Saul's madness, which was relieved by David's harp playing. This is certainly to the point, and may well have been in Shakespeare's mind. [See George Herbert's poem, 'Doomsday,' verse 2.]</p>
<p>Our modern Tarantellas derive their name and characteristic speed from the old Tarantula.</p>
<p><i>Lear</i> I, ii, 137. Edmund pretends not to see Edgar's entrance.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Edmund (aside).</i> Pat he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue is villainous melancholy, with a <i>sigh like Tom o' Bedlam</i>.—O! these eclipses do portend <i>these divisions</i>. <i>Fa, sol, la, mi.</i></p>
</div>
<p><a id="Page_36" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 36]"></a></p>
<p>Songs like 'Tom o' Bedlam,' mad-songs they were called, were very commonly sung in England in the 17th century. The tune and words of the original 'Tom a Bedlam' are to be found in Chappell, Vol. I. p. 175. Its date is some time before 1626,<a id="FNanchor_6_6"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[6]</a> and verse 1 begins, 'From the hagg and hungrie Goblin,' and the whole is as full of ejaculations of 'Poor Tom' as Act III. of <i>Lear</i>.</p>
<p>The last sentence has yet another play on the double meaning of 'divisions.' A few lines further on Edmund explains what kind of 'divisions' he expects to follow the eclipses—namely, 'between the child and the parent ... dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,' etc. But the very use of the word in the quoted lines brings its musical meaning into his head, for he promptly carries off his assumed blindness to Edgar's presence by humming over his 'fa, sol, la, mi.' [Burney, Hist., Vol. III. p. 344, has a sensible observation on this passage—that Edgar alludes to the unnatural division of parent and child, etc., in this musical phrase, which contains the<a id="Page_37" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 37]"></a> augmented fourth, or <i>mi contra fa</i>, of which the old theorists used to say 'diabolus est.']</p>
<p>Guido d'Arezzo (or Aretinus), in his Micrologus (about 1024), named the six notes of the Hexachord (<i>e.g.</i>, C, D, E, F, G, A), thus—Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La. These were the first syllables of certain words in the Hymn for the feast of St John Baptist, the words and tune of which are in Hawkins, p. 163.</p>

<p>A rough translation of which is—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>'That thy servants may be able with free hearts to sound forth the wonders of thy deeds; release us, O Holy John, from the guilt of a defiled lip.'</p>
</div>
<p>In the ancient tune of this verse, the notes assigned to the syllables in capitals were successively those of the scale, C, D, E, F, G, A, and these same syllables were still used in singing in the 16th century. It was noticed, however, that the scale could be easily expressed by fewer names, and accordingly we find Christopher Sympson (1667) saying, in his 'Compendium,' that Ut and Re are 'superfluous, and<a id="Page_38" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 38]"></a> therefore laid aside by most Modern Teachers.' In his book, the whole scale of <i>eight</i> notes is named thus—Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La, <i>mi</i>, Fa. A modern Tonic Solfaist would understand this arrangement quite differently. C, D, E would be called Do (instead of Ut), Re, Mi; then would follow F, G, A, under the names Fa, Sol, La; and the 'leading note' [top note but one] would be called Ti (instead of Si); the octave C beginning once more with Do.</p>
<p>The reader will remember that the tonal relation of C, D, E is exactly the same as that of the next three notes, F, G, A—viz., C—D, a tone; D—E, a tone; and similarly with F—G, G—A. Therefore the two blocks of three notes (which are separated by a <i>semi</i>-tone) might have the same names—viz., Fa, sol, la. Thus we have the first <i>six</i> notes of the scale, Fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la. There only remains one note, the 'leading note,' the B; and this, in Sympson, is named <i>Mi</i>. So the principal thing in the sol-fa-ing of a passage was to 'place the Mi,' or, as we should now put it, to find 'what key' it is in. Thus, in the key of C, Mi is in B: in G, Mi is in F sharp: in F, Mi is in E, and so on, the remaining six notes being named Fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, as explained above.<a id="Page_39" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 39]"></a></p>
<p>Edmund's 'Fa, Sol, La, Mi,' therefore, corresponds to F, G, A, B; or C, D, E, F sharp; or B flat, C, D, E, etc.; according to the pitch taken by the singer.</p>
<p>In this connection see the following passage:—</p>
<p><i>Shrew</i> I, ii, 16.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Petr.</i> 'Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll <i>wring</i> it:<br/>
<span class="c10">I'll try how you can <i>sol, fa</i>, and <i>sing it</i>.'</span></p>
<p><span class="c15">[He wrings <span class="smcap">Grumio</span> by the ears.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Here is a pun on 'wring' and 'ring'; and 'sol-fa' is used as an equivalent for 'sing.'</p>
<p>More important still is 'the gamut of Hortensio,' <i>Shrew</i> III, i, 72. [Gam-ut was the name of the Ut of lowest pitch, corresponding to the low G on the first line of our present bass staff, and was marked specially with a Greek Gamma, hence Gam-ut. The word became a synonym for 'the Scale.']</p>
<p>In this passage the names of the notes are simply those to be found in all instruction books of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr>
<td>'Gam-ut I am, the ground of all accord,<br/>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here Hortensio puts in his love-verses under the guise of a musicmaster's Gamut.</p>
<p>The lines may be taken separately as fantastic commentaries on the syllables themselves, as well as having their ulterior meaning for Bianca.</p>
<p>For instance, Gam-ut the <i>lowest</i> note then recognised in the scale, is called 'the <i>ground</i> of all <i>accord</i>.' A-re, I suppose, represents the lover's sigh 'to plead his passion.' B-mi, may be twisted into 'Be mine,' by the light of the remaining words in the line; while 'D sol re, one cliff, two notes have I' obviously refers to Hortensio's disguise. The 'cliff' is what is now called a 'clef,' or 'key,' because its position on the staff gave the 'key' to the position of the semitones and tones on the various lines and spaces. The six notes here mentioned are the G, A, B, C, D, E, in the bass staff. They could only be written (as they are yet) in <i>one</i> clef—namely, the F clef. The expression 'two notes have I,' as applied to the D, means that, in the key of G, D is called Sol; while in the key of C it would have the name Re; just as Hortensio is Hortensio, and at the same time masquerades as a singing-master.<a id="Page_41" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 41]"></a></p>
<p>It has been mentioned that the art of adding an extempore counterpoint to a written melody was called 'descant.' The written melody itself was called the 'Plain-song,' and hence the whole performance, plainsong and descant together, came to be known by the term 'Plain-song,' as opposed to the performance of plainsong with a <i>written</i> descant; which was known as 'Prick-song.'</p>
<p>Morley gives us a clear idea that the extempore descant was often a very unsatisfactory performance, at any rate when it was attempted to add more than one extempore part at a time to the plainsong. As he says—'For though they should all be moste excellent men ... it is unpossible for them to be true one to another.' The following passage will be more clear on this light.</p>
<p><i>H. 5.</i> III, ii, 3. Fight at Harfleur.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Nym.</i> Pray thee, corporal, stay: ... the humour of it is too hot, that is the very <i>plain-song</i> of it.</p>
<p><i>Pistol.</i> <i>The plain-song is most just</i>, for humours do abound.</p>
<p class="c2">* * * * *</p>
<p>L. 41.</p>
<p><i>Boy</i> (speaks of the 3 rogues).... They will steal anything, and call it purchase. Bardolph <i>stole a lute-case</i>, bore it twelve leagues, and <i>sold it for three half-pence</i>.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="Page_42" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 42]"></a></p>
<p>Falstaff's worthy body-guard are getting tired of hard knocks in fight; Nym compares their late activity to a somewhat florid 'plain-song' [meaning an extempore descant, as explained above]; Pistol says it is a 'just' plainsong. A 'just' plainsong would mean that the singer had managed his extempore descant 'without singing eyther false chords or forbidden descant one to another.' Similarly, there is little doubt that both Ancient and Corporal managed to take a part in the skirmishings with as little damage as possible to their sconces.</p>
<p>The speech of the boy at l. 41 hardly enrols Bardolph amongst music lovers. At all events he stole a lute-case, and seems to have liked it so much that he carried it 36 miles before his worser nature prevailed on him to sell it for 1-1/2d.</p>
<p>The next quotation still concerns Jack Falstaff and his crew, all of whom (and strictly in accordance with history) seem to have been sound practical musicians. This time they are speaking, not of descant, but of Prick-song. The chiefest virtue in the performance of Prick-song, by which Falstaff and Nym probably understood both sacred and secular part-music, is that a man should 'keep time,' religiously counting his rests, 'one, two, three, and the third in your bosom,'<a id="Page_43" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 43]"></a> and when he begins to sing, that he should 'keep time, distance, and proportion,' as Mercutio says Tybalt did in his fencing, see <i>Romeo</i> II, iv, 20.</p>
<p>All this is thoroughly appreciated by Falstaff and his corporal in the following lines:—</p>
<p><i>Merry Wiv.</i> I, iii, 25.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Falstaff</i> (of Bardolph) ... his thefts were too open; his filching was <i>like an unskilful singer</i>, he <i>kept not time</i>.</p>
<p><i>Nym.</i> The good humour is to <i>steal at a minim's rest</i>.</p>
<p class="c2">['Minims' is a modern conjecture.]</p>
</div>
<p>The metaphor is of an anthem or madrigal, say in four parts. We will suppose the Hostess of the 'Garter' is taking the <i>Cantus</i>, a tapster the <i>Altus</i>, mine Host the <i>Tenor</i>, and Nym the <i>Bassus</i>. The three former are all hard at work on their respective 'parts,' one in the kitchen, another in the taproom, the third in familiar converse outside the front door. But Nym has 'a minim rest,' and during that short respite takes advantage of the absorbing occupations of the other three 'singers' to lay hands on whatever portable property is within his reach. 'A minim rest' is not much—but the point remains. Any musician has had experience of what can be done during a short 'rest'—<i>e.g.</i>, to resin his bow,<a id="Page_44" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 44]"></a> or turn up the corners of the next few pages of his music, light the gas, or find his place in another book.</p>
<p>By an easy transition we pass to the following:—</p>
<p><i>Pericles</i> I, i, 81. Pericles addresses the daughter of King Antiochus.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Per.</i> You're a <i>fair viol</i>, and <i>your sense the strings</i>,<br/>

<p>Pericles compares the lawful love of a wife with the performance of a good viol player, the proper characteristics of which would be, 'in tune,' and 'in time.' The comparison in l. 84 is of this girl's lawless passion with the 'disorder'd' playing of a bad violist, who has got 'out,' as we say; who is playing 'before his time,' thus entirely spoiling the music, which becomes a dance for devils rather than angels.</p>
<p>The viol was decidedly the most important stringed instrument played with a bow that was in use in Elizabethan times. There were three different sizes.</p>
<p>The reader will get a sufficiently accurate idea,<a id="Page_45" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 45]"></a> both of the sizes and the use of viols, if he will consider the treble viol to have corresponded closely with our modern violin, the tenor viol to the modern viola [which is also called Alto, Tenor, or Bratsche—<i>i.e.</i>, braccio, 'arm' fiddle], and the bass-viol, or viol-da-gamba [so called because held between the knees], to the modern violoncello.</p>
<p>The principal difference from our modern stringed instruments was that all the viols had <i>six</i> strings, whereas now there is no 'fiddle' of any sort with more than four. A secondary difference was, that all the viol family had <i>frets</i> on the fingerboard to mark out the notes, whereas the finger-boards of all our modern instruments are smooth, and the finger of the performer has to do without any help of that kind.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[7]</a></p>
<p>John Playford, in 1683, published his 'Introduction to the Skill of Music,' which gives an account of the viols, and Thomas Mace, of Cambridge, lay clerk of Trinity, in his 'Musick's Monument,' pub. 1676, gives full instructions how many viols and other instruments of this kind are necessary. From these we learn that viols were always kept in sets of six—two trebles, two tenors, and two basses—which<a id="Page_46" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 46]"></a> set was technically known as a 'Chest' of viols. Mace also says that the treble viol had its strings just half the length of the bass viol, and the tenor was of a medium size between these. Also he says that if you add to these a couple of violins (which were then thought somewhat vulgar, loud instruments) for jovial occasions, and a pair of 'lusty, full-sized Theorboes,'<a id="FNanchor_8_8"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[8]</a> 'you have a ready entertainment for the greatest prince in the world.'</p>
<p>The tuning of the six strings on the <i>bass</i>-viol was, on the bass staff, 1st string, or treble, D over the staff; 2nd or small mean, A on the top line; 3rd or great mean, E in the third space; 4th or counter-tenor, C in the second space; 5th or tenor, or gamut, G on the first line; and the 6th or bass, low D, under the staff. On the most complete viol there would be seven frets, arranged semitonally, so the compass of the Bass Viol or Viol da Gamba would be about two octaves and a half, from D under the bass staff to A on the second space of the treble staff. [In South Kensington Museum<a id="Page_47" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 47]"></a> is a Viol da Gamba with no less than twelve frets still remaining. This would make the compass nearly <i>three</i> octaves.]</p>
<p>The tenor-viol had its top string tuned to G on the second line of the treble staff; and the remaining five were the same in pitch as the top five on the bass viol. The treble viol (as mentioned above) was tuned exactly an octave above the bass.</p>
<p>The tone of the viols is very much like that of our modern bowed instruments, the principal difference being that they are a little feebler, and naturally more calm. The reason is that vigorous 'bowing' is a risky thing on the viol, for, as there are <i>six</i> strings on the arc of the bridge, more care is required to avoid striking two or even three at once than on the violin, which has only four.</p>
<p>The amateur of music would keep a 'Chest' of six Viols in his house, and when his musical friends visited him, they would generally play 'Fancies' (or Fantasias) see <i>H. 4. B.</i> III, ii, 323, in several parts, from two to the full six, according to the number of those present. Amongst a great number of composers of this kind of music, some very well known names are, John Jenkins, Chris. Sympson, William Lawes, Coperario (John Cooper), and the Italian<a id="Page_48" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 48]"></a> Monteverde. It was common for the Organ or other keyed instrument to join with the viols in these pieces, and thus fill out the chords of the 'consort,' as it was called.</p>
<p>We still have one of the viol tribe left in our orchestra. The double-bass (or viol-one) is lineal descendant of the Chest of viols. Its shape, especially at the shoulders, is quite characteristic, and elsewhere—<i>e.g.</i>, the blunt curves of the waist, the outline of the back, and even the shape of the bow.</p>
<p>The practice of playing extempore variations on the viol da gamba has already been mentioned as one of the elegant accomplishments of a gentleman in those days. The following two quotations therefore will not require further remark.</p>
<p><i>Tw.</i> I, iii, 24.</p>

<p>The <i>violin</i> family had only a precarious footing amongst musicians up to 1650. After that time, the viols declined in favour, and so rapidly, that at the very beginning of the 18th century, Dr Tudway of Cambridge describes a chest of viols, in a letter to his son, with such particularity, that it is clear they had entirely fallen out of use by 1700. As the viol fell out of fashion, the violin took its place, and has kept it ever since.</p>
<p>The violin family had come into general and fashionable use under the patronage of the Court of Louis XIV., and thus the English nation, true to their ancient habit of buying their 'doublet in Italy, round hose in France, bonnet in Germany, and behaviour everywhere,' took up the 'French fiddles,' and let their national Chest of viols go to the wall.</p>
<p>This growing tendency to adopt French customs, even in music, is referred to in the following:—</p>
<p><i>Hen. VIII.</i> I, iii, 41. French manners in England.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Lovell.</i> A <i>French song</i>, and a <i>fiddle</i>, has no fellow.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="c10">And have an hour of hearing: and, by'r lady,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Held <i>current music</i> too.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>The only word here that has not already been fully explained is 'current music,' which I suppose to mean simply, that the old accomplishments of which Lord Sands speaks would be still thought 'up to date' and in the fashion.</p>
<p>Another instrument in common domestic use was the Recorder. This was a kind of 'Beak-flute,' like a flageolet. Lord Bacon says it had a conical bore, and six holes. So it had the general figure of a modern Oboe, but was played with a 'whistle' mouthpiece instead of a reed.</p>
<p>The six holes may still be seen on any penny whistle, or the brass flageolets in the music-shops.</p>
<p>The Recorder was known for its sweet tone. Poets used the word 'record' to signify the song of birds, especially of the nightingale.</p>
<p>Hawkins identifies it with the Fistula Dulcis, seu Anglica, and gives two pictures which help to explain the next quotation.</p>
<p>In South Kensington Museum there is a Recorder<a id="FNanchor_9_9"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[9]</a><a id="Page_51" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 51]"></a> made of a dark wood, which is nothing else but a big flageolet. Its length is 2 ft. 2 in., and its bore is that of the modern flageolet and old flute—viz., conical, but with the wide end nearest the player's mouth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>
<p>The holes in a flute have always been called 'ventages,' because the 'wind' comes through them<a id="Page_52" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 52]"></a> when the fingers are removed. They were 'governed' 'with the finger and thumb.' One of the illustrations from Mersennus [b. 1588] shows a conical flute with four holes in front and two at the back. These latter would, of course, be controlled by the <i>thumbs</i>, while the others would occupy two fingers on each hand. (Modern flageolets still keep a thumb hole at the back.) There were other beaked flutes of the same period, of a better class, which had several keys as well as the holes.</p>
<p>'The stops' referred to by Hamlet are merely the 'ventages.' The act of covering a hole with the finger or thumb was called 'stopping'; and further, one example of the Fistula Dulcis given by Mersennus has two different holes for the lowest note, one on the right and the other on the left, so that the instrument might be used either by a right-handed or left-handed person. One of these two duplicate holes was temporarily <i>stopped</i> with wax. [The passing play upon 'fret' in the last line should not be missed.]</p>
<p>In the next passage the meaning of stop as applied to Recorders is punned on by Hippolyta, who carries on the play from Lysander's horsebreaking metaphor.</p>
<p><i>Mids.</i> V, i, 108. The Prologue speaks with all the punctuation wrong.<a id="Page_53" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 53]"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hippolyta.</i> Indeed, he hath played on this prologue like a <i>child on a recorder, a sound</i>, but <i>not in government</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>That is—the Prologue has misplaced all his <i>stops</i>—like a young horse that refuses to <i>stop</i>—also like a child who has not learned to <i>stop</i> the holes on the flute <i>à bec</i>.</p>
<p>It is singular that the Virginal, which was the most popular of all the keyed instruments, is nowhere directly named in Shakespeare. There is, however, a reference to the action of the fingers on its keys in the following.</p>
<p><i>Winter's Tale</i> I, ii, 125. Of <i>Hermione</i>, Queen of Leontes, King of Sicilia, and <i>Polixenes</i>, King of Bohemia.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Leon.</i> —— still <i>virginalling</i><br/>

</div>
<p>The Virginal (generally known as 'a <i>pair</i> of virginals') was most commonly used by ladies for their private recreation, and from this circumstance is supposed to derive its name. Queen Elizabeth was fond of playing on it, but as it was in vogue before her time, there is no need to connect the<a id="Page_54" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 54]"></a> name with the Virgin Queen. (Elizabeth's own Virginal is in South Kensington Museum.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[10]</a>) Its keyboard has four octaves, and the case is square, like that of a very old pianoforte. The strings of the virginal were plucked, by quills,<a id="FNanchor_11_11"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[11]</a> which were secured to the 'jacks' [see Sonnet cxxviii.], which in turn were set in motion by the keys. The strings were wire. The oldest country dance known, the Sellenger's (St Leger's) Round, of Henry VIII.'s time, was arranged by Byrd as a Virginal 'lesson' for 'Lady Nevell's booke.' Another well-known Virginal Book, that at the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge, commonly known as 'Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book,' is being published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel.</p>
<p>The first music ever printed for the Virginals was 'Parthenia,' published in London, 1611. This collection contains principally Pavans and Galliards by Byrd, Bull, and Gibbons. The title 'Parthenia, or the Maydenhead of the firste musicke,' etc., with a picture of a young lady playing on the virginal, seems to confirm our explanation of the name of this instrument.<a id="Page_55" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 55]"></a></p>
<p>Next to the viol, the lute<a id="FNanchor_12_12"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[12]</a> was the most popular stringed instrument. It was used both as a Solo instrument on which to play sprightly 'Ayres,' or as an accompaniment for the voice, or 'in consort' with other instruments. Naturally, it figured frequently in 'serenading' especially when a love song had to be sung outside a lady's window. The general shape of a Lute was that of a mandoline, but about four times as big. Like the mandoline, it had a flat belly, and a great basin-shaped back. But in every other respect it was entirely different. It was used more in the fashion of a guitar, and its strings (which were of gut) were plucked with the fingers.</p>
<p>Adrian Le Roy's book, published in Paris about 1570, says the six strings were tuned as follows—1st (minikin), C in third space, treble staff; 2nd (small mean), G on second line; 3rd (great mean), D under the staff; 4th (counter-tenor), B flat over the bass staff; 5th (tenor), F on fourth line; and 6th (base), C in second space.</p>
<p>Scipione Cerreto, however (Naples 1601), gives quite a different account of the Italian Lute of eight strings, the tuning of which seems to have extended the compass downwards to C under the bass staff. Thomas<a id="Page_56" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 56]"></a> Mace (Musicks Monument, 1676) tells of several objections against the lute, the most noteworthy of which were—1st, that it was a costly instrument to keep in repair; 2nd, that it was out of fashion; and 3rd, that it <i>made young people grow awry</i>. Mace refutes these calumnies, the last of which no doubt was set about on account of the very awkward shape of the lute back, and the considerable size of the instrument. Hawkins (Hist. of Music, pp. 730 and 731) gives two pieces for the lute by Mace, or, rather, the same piece twice, first for one lute, then arranged for two. [<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>.]</p>
<p>The five lower strings of the lute were 'doubled'—<i>i.e.</i>, there were two of each pitch, duplicates, which helped the tone of the chords by 'sympathetic' vibration. So there were really eleven strings, but only six different pitches. There were eight frets on the fingerboard.</p>
<p>Other varieties were the Arch-Lute<a id="FNanchor_13_13"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[13]</a> and the Theorbo-Lute, both of which had very long double necks, and a large number of strings. One Archlute in South Kensington Museum has as many as 24, eleven of which are duplications.</p>
