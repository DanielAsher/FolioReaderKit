<p>The first of these three passages will be quite clear to the reader in the light of the remarks on the lute<a id="Page_61" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 61]"></a> already made. The second should be read in connection with the name of the doleful dance above mentioned, the Dump. [See <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>.]</p>
<p>The third quotation contains interesting allusions to the peculiarities of the lute. Lines 22-25 are very naturally accounted for. The lute, having at least eleven strings, took a long time to get into tune. Even our modern violins, with only four strings, want constant attention in this respect; and the lute, therefore, especially in the hands of an amateur, might well get a name for being a troublesome instrument. The reference to the 'treble' and 'bass' strings (<i>i.e.</i>, the 1st and 6th) has been explained before. 'Spit in the hole, man,' Lucentio's very rude advice to Hortensio, will direct our attention to the variously shaped 'holes' which were made in the belly of all stringed instruments to let out the sound. On the lute, this hole was commonly a circular opening, not clearly cut out, but fretted in a circle of small holes with a star in the middle. But this was not the only way. A lute in South Kensington Museum has <i>three</i> round holes, placed in an oblique line, nearly at the bottom of the instrument.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[14]</a> The holes on the viol were generally in the form of crescents,<a id="Page_62" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 62]"></a> and were put one on each side of the bridge. On the modern violins, as everybody has seen, they are in the shape of <img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@images@violin.jpg" alt="f holes" title="f holes" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/>, and are known as '<i>f</i>' holes.</p>
<p>Line 59, about 'lessons in three parts,' is of interest. Primarily, it is another form of 'Two's company, three is none'—but its musical meaning is very plainly present. In the 16th and 17th centuries it was very common to call the pieces of music in any volume for an instrument by the name 'Lessons.' The first meaning, of course, was that they were examples for the pupil in music, but the word was used quite freely with the purely general signification of 'Pieces' or 'Movements.'</p>
<p>One more word deserves remark—viz., 'to touch,' in line 63. This is used technically, and means strictly 'to play' on the instrument. The word comes both in meaning and form from Ital., <i>toccare</i>.</p>
<p><i>Toccata</i> was a common word for a Prelude (often extempore), intended as a kind of introduction to two or three more formal movements. The Italian for a peal of bells is <i>tocco di campana</i>, and we have the word in English under the form <i>tocsin</i>, an alarm bell. The trumpet-call known as 'Tucket,' which occurs seven times in the stage directions of six Shakespeare<a id="Page_63" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 63]"></a> plays, and is also found once in the text (<i>Henry V.</i> IV, ii, 35), also is derived from <i>toccare</i>. Similarly with the German 'Tusch,' a flourish of trumpets and other brass instruments, which may be heard under that name to the present day.</p>
<p>The next passage confirms Morley's account of the high estimation in which music was held as a part of a liberal education. Baptista evidently considers 'good bringing up' to include 'music, instruments, and poetry.' Moreover, the visiting master was to be well paid,—'to cunning men I will be very kind.'</p>
<p><i>Shrew</i> I, i, 81.</p>

<span class="c10"><i>I will be very kind</i>, and liberal</span><br/>

</div>
<p><a id="Page_64" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 64]"></a>We find further on, in the same play, that to bring one's lady-love a music master was thought a handsome compliment.</p>

<p>Moreover, in <i>Pericles</i> IV, vi, 185, we find that Marina, daughter of Prince Pericles, can '<i>sing</i>, weave, sew, and <i>dance</i>.' Also see V, i, 78, where Marina actually does sing, to rouse her father from his melancholy.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00015"><span class="smcap">Songs and Singing</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible here to give even an outline of the history of Songs and Singing in England. The general statement must suffice that vocal music, accompanied by viols and harps, with songs and catches, were common in the year 1230 in France; and any reader of Chaucer and Gower may see for himself that vocal music was flourishing in the 14th century in England. The English Round or Catch, mentioned above, 'Sumer is icumen in,' is most probably of the 13th century, and that alone would be sufficient to characterise the popular vocal music of that day. This composition is advanced in every way, being very melodious, and at the same time showing that vocal harmony (<i>i.e.</i>, singing in parts) was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>To proceed to a time nearer the age with which we are concerned—in Henry VII.'s reign, there were many songs written, some for voices only, and some with<a id="Page_66" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 66]"></a> instrumental accompaniment. Amongst the former are two songs in three parts, the music by William Cornyshe, Junior, which are given in Hawkins.</p>
<p>Skelton wrote the words of the first, 'Ah, beshrew you by my fay,' which is very coarse in tone, as was frequently the case with him; and the second one, 'Hoyday, jolly ruttekin,' is a satire on the drunken habits of the Flemings who came over with Anne of Cleves. Mrs Page (<i>Wiv.</i> II, i, 23) refers to these Dutchmen, where, after receiving Falstaff's love-letter, she exclaims, 'what an unweighed behaviour hath this <i>Flemish Drunkard</i> picked (with the devil's name!) out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?'</p>
<p>The following is a curious picture by 'Skelton, Laureate,' of an ignorant singer, who appears to have been throwing mud at the poet. Skelton gives us a sad account both of his morals and his music.</p>

<p>Skelton's main objection to this person is that he, being in reality of very humble origin, presumed on his very doubtful musical abilities to gain a foot<a id="Page_68" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 68]"></a>ing amongst his betters. As he says, 'For Jak wold be a Jentilman that late was a grome.'</p>
<p>Evidently 'Jak' had managed to make good his position as a fashionable teacher of singing, in spite of the defects plainly mentioned in the above verses. In the first verse, 'counter' is a musical term, here used with the meaning of 'to embroider' the tale. 'Knack' is still used in Yorkshire for 'affected talk.' 'Monachord' is the ancient one-stringed fiddle called Tromba Marina, and is here used as a joke on 'monachi' or 'holy water clarks.' In verse 2, '<i>rule</i> and space' is simply 'line and space,' <i>i.e.</i>, on the musical staff. 'Solfyth too haute' is 'Solfa's too high.' The 'my' which was 'too sharp' is the Mi, the seventh note of the scale, mentioned above as the critical point in Solfa. In verse 3, 'lewde lewte' means merely 'vulgar lute'; and 'Rotybulle Joyse' is the title of an old song. The 'payre of clavicordys' is the clavichord, which in 1536 was a keyed instrument of much the same kind as the virginals,<a id="FNanchor_16_16"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[16]</a> with about three and a half octaves. It<a id="Page_69" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 69]"></a> was used by nuns, and therefore had its strings muffled with bits of cloth to deaden the sound.</p>
<p>The last three lines quoted mention 'solfa' and 'fayne.' The latter is 'feigned' music, or Musica Ficta, which at this time was the art of dislocating the 'Mi,' so as to change the key. It was seldom that more than one flat was found in those days, and this would move the Mi from <i>B</i> to <i>E</i>, thus constituting 'fayned' music.</p>
<p>This account will give a general idea of the kind of songs and singing that were to be found in 1500.</p>
<p>Popular songs, 'Rotybulle Joyse,' with a burden of 'Rumbill downe, tumbill downe,' etc., accompanied by a 'lewde lewte'; clavichord playing; solfaing; singing of both 'prick-' and 'plain-' song, with Musica Ficta; besides the delectable art of 'whysteling'; seem to have been matters in ordinary practice at the beginning of the 16th century. Add to these the songs in three parts, with rounds or catches for several voices, and we have no mean list of musicianly accomplishments, which the men of Shakespeare's day might inherit.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare, besides the songs most commonly known (some of which are by earlier authors), there are allusions to many kinds of vocal music, and<a id="Page_70" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 70]"></a> scraps of the actual words of old songs—some with accompaniment, some without; a duet; a trio; a chorus; not to mention several rounds, either quoted or alluded to.</p>
<p>It will be useful here to refer to a few of these less known examples.</p>
<p><i>L.L.L.</i> I, ii, 106. The Ballad of 'The King and the Beggar.' Moth says "The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for the writing, nor the tune."</p>
<p><i>Id.</i> III, i, 2. Moth begins a song 'Concolinel,' which Armado calls a 'sweet air.'</p>
<p>Various snatches of ballads, ancient and modern—<i>e.g.</i>,</p>

<p>Also see <i>Wiv.</i> V, v, 20. The tune is given in its most complete form by Chappell, and is probably of Henry VIII.'s time. The ballad was published in 1580,<a id="Page_75" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 75]"></a> with title, 'A new Northerne dittye of the Ladye Greene Sleeves.' Verse 1 is as follows:—</p>

<p>The 'Hundredth Psalm' (All people that on earth do dwell) will only adhere and keep place with the tune of Green Sleeves to a certain extent.

There is, however, a form of the tune in Hawkins which is much further off 'the truth of the words,' for it has exactly the right quantity of <i>notes</i>, but the <i>accents</i> are all as wrong as possible, thus—</p>

<p>The Carman's Whistle was a popular Elizabethan tune, and was arranged as a virginal lesson by Byrd. This arrangement can be had most readily in Litolff's publication, 'Les maîtres du Clavecin.'</p>

<p>The one line of 'Bonny sweet Robin' is all that remains of the song, except the title, which is also the first line—viz., 'My Robin is to the greenwood gone.' The line Shakespeare gives would be the last. One tune to it is at any rate older than 1597.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are the old catches, 'Hold thy peace,' sung by Toby, Sir Andrew, and Feste in <i>Twelfth Night</i> II, iii; 'Jack boy, ho boy, news, The cat is in the well,' etc., referred to by Grumio in <i>Shrew</i> IV, i, 42; besides 'Flout 'em and scout em,' sung by Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban in <i>Tempest</i> III, ii; and 'What shall he have that killed the deer,' for the foresters in <i>As You Like It</i> IV, ii, 5.

A Round for four voices by John Hilton (flourished 1600) to 'What shall he have,' is probably the first setting, and may be seen in Rimbault, p. 19. Purcell (1675) set 'Flout 'em' as a catch for three voices, which is in Caulfield's Collection of Shakespeare Vocal Music, 1864. These last two are poor specimens of Catches, so they are not printed here. [The proper reading of 'Flout 'em,' in the 4tos and 1st Fol. is<a id="Page_78" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 78]"></a> 'Flout 'em and <i>cout</i> 'em! and <i>skowt</i> 'em, and flout 'em!

<p>The following passage contains a large quantity of the history of songs in the 16th century, and is one of the most important to be found in Shakespeare. Autolycus sells ballads 'of all sizes' among his wares; the country folk, Mopsa, Dorcas, and the Clown, buy them, and afterwards sing them; and the rustic servant distinctly prefers the pedlar's vocalisation to their accustomed 'tabor and pipe,' or even to the 'bagpipe.'</p>
<p><i>Winter's Tale</i> IV, iii, 181.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Servant.</i> O master! if you did but hear the <i>pedlar</i> at the door, you would <i>never dance again after a tabor and pipe</i>; no, the <i>bagpipe</i> could not move you. He <i>sings several tunes</i> faster than you'll tell money; he utters them as he had <i>eaten ballads</i>, and all men's ears grew to his tunes.</p>
<p><i>Clown.</i> He could never come better: he shall come in. <i>I love a ballad</i> but even too well; if it be doleful matter, merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed, and sung lamentably.</p>
<p><i>Serv.</i> He hath <i>songs</i>, for man or woman, <i>of all sizes</i>.... He has the prettiest <i>love-songs</i> for maids; so without bawdry, which is strange; with such <i>delicate burdens</i> of "dildos" and "fadings," "jump her and thump her"; ... "<i>Whoop, do me no harm, good man.</i>"<a id="Page_79" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 79]"></a></p>
<p>L. 212.</p>
<p><i>Clo.</i> Pr'ythee, bring him in, and let him <i>approach singing</i>.</p>
<p><i>Perdita.</i> Forewarn him, that he use <i>no scurrilous words</i> in 's tunes.</p>
<p>L. 259.</p>
<p><i>Clo.</i> [to Autolycus]. What hast here? <i>ballads</i>?</p>
<p><i>Mopsa.</i> 'Pray now, buy some: I love a <i>ballad in print</i>, o' life, for <i>then we are sure they are true</i>.</p>
<p><i>Autolycus.</i> Here's one to a <i>very doleful tune</i> ... [of a usurer's wife].</p>
<p>L. 273.</p>
<p><i>Clo.</i> Come on, lay it by: and let's first see <i>more ballads</i>....</p>
<p><i>Aut.</i> Here's <i>another ballad, of a fish</i>, that ... sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids: ... the ballad is <i>very pitiful</i>, and as true.</p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> This is a <i>merry ballad</i>, but a <i>very pretty</i> one.</p>
<p><i>Mop.</i> Let's have some merry ones.</p>
<p><i>Aut.</i> Why, this is a passing merry one, and <i>goes to the tune of</i> "Two maids wooing a man," there's scarce a maid westward but she sings it: <i>'tis in request</i>, I can tell you.</p>
<p><i>Mop.</i> We can <i>both</i> sing it: if <i>thou'lt bear a part</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, Autolycus], thou shalt hear; 'tis in <i>three parts</i>.</p>
<p><i>Dorcas.</i> We had the <i>tune</i> on't a month ago.<a id="Page_80" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 80]"></a></p>
<p><i>Aut.</i> <i>I can bear my part</i>; you must know, <i>'tis my occupation</i>: have at it with you.</p>
<p class="c18">[They sing 'Get you hence,' in three parts.]</p>

<p><i>Servant.</i> Master, there is <i>three</i> carters, <i>three</i> shepherds, <i>three</i> neat herds, <i>three</i> swine herds, that have made themselves all <i>men of hair</i>: they call themselves <i>Saltiers</i>; and they have a <i>dance</i>, which the wenches say is a <i>gallimaufry</i> of gambols, because they are not in't....</p>

<p><i>Aut.</i> <i>My clown</i> (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches' <i>song</i>, that he would not stir his pettitoes, <i>till he had both tune and words</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>The tabor and pipe, in the servant's first speech, were common popular instruments. The tabor, of course, was a small drum, which was used as accompaniment to the pipe, a small whistle with three holes, but with a compass of 18 notes. (See <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-0.htm.html#DESCRIPTION_OF_FRONTISPIECE" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Frontispiece</a>.) In its curiously disproportionate compass, it may be compared to the modern 'Picco' pipe of the music shops. Mersennus (middle of 17th century) mentions an Englishman, John Price, who was an<a id="Page_81" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 81]"></a> accomplished player. It is played on by Ariel, see a subsequent quotation from <i>The Tempest</i> III, ii, 126 and 152. Also <i>Much Ado</i> II, iii, 13; and the tabor alone, in <i>Twelfth Night</i> III, i.</p>
<p>The Bagpipe<a id="FNanchor_17_17"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[17]</a> was very similar to the instruments of that name which still exist. At the present moment there are four kinds in use—Highland Scotch, Lowland Scotch, Northumbrian, and Irish. The last has bellows instead of a 'bag,' but in other ways they are very much alike. They all have 'drones,' which sound a particular note or notes continually, while the tune is played on the 'chanter.' Shakespeare himself tells us of another variety—viz., the Lincolnshire bagpipe, in <i>Hen. 4. A.</i> I, ii, 76, where Falstaff compares his low spirits to the melancholy 'drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.'<a id="FNanchor_18_18"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[18]</a></p>
<p>The servant's second speech refers to the character of the words of the popular ballads, which were too often coarse and even indecent.</p>
<p>'Love-songs' are quite a large class, frequently referred to. For instance, <i>Two Gent.</i> II, i, 15.<a id="Page_82" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 82]"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Val.</i> Why, how know you that I am in love?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Speed.</i> Marry by these special marks.<br/>
<span class="c10">First, you have learn'd ...</span><br/>
<span class="c10"><i>To relish a love song</i>, like a robin-redbreast;</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p><i>Rom.</i> II, iv, 15.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Mercutio.</i> 'Alas, poor Romeo! he is already dead;<br/>
<span class="c10">... run thorough the ear <i>with a love-song</i>.'</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>besides the passage from <i>Twelfth Nt.</i> II, iii, quoted further on, where Feste offers Sir Toby and Sir Andrew their choice between 'a love-song, or a song of good life.'</p>
<p>The 'delicate burdens,' 'dildos and fadings,' 'jump her and thump her,' are to be found in examples of the period. A Round of Matt. White, 'The Courtier scorns the country clowns' (date about 1600) has for its third and last line 'With a fading, fading, fading, fading,' etc. 'Whoop, do me no harm' has already been spoken of.</p>
<p>In l. 214 of the <i>Winter's Tale</i> passage, Perdita again takes precaution against Autolycus using 'scurrilous words.'</p>
<p>From l. 285 to l. 327, the passage refers to a very interesting department of 16th century singing—viz., the habit of performing songs in three vocal parts. The singers were called Threeman-songmen, and the<a id="Page_83" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 83]"></a> songs themselves 'Threeman songs,' or 'Freemen's Songs.' [<i>Freemen</i> is simply a corruption of <i>Threemen</i>. Mr Aldis Wright tells me it is analogous to <i>Thills</i> or <i>Fills</i>, for the shafts of a waggon. Rimbault, in the preface to 'Rounds, Canons, and Catches,' is highly indignant with Ritson's 'inconceivably strange notion' that Freemen is only a form of Threemen. Rimbault's reason was that 'Deuteromelia' (1609) does contain Freemen's Songs in <i>four</i> parts. Mr Aldis Wright also gives me the expression '<i>six</i>-men's song,' from Percy's Reliques, also these definitions, which will all go to settle the matter: Florio, Italian Dictionary, 1611; <i>Strambotti</i>, country gigges, rounds, catches, virelaies or <i>threemen's songs</i>; <i>Cantarini</i>, such as sing <i>threemen's songs</i>; <i>Berlingozzo</i>.... Also a drunken or <i>threemen's song</i>.</p>
<p>Cotgrave, French Dict. 1611; Virelay. m. A virelay, round, <i>free</i>mans song].</p>
<p>Giraldus Cambrensis says that singing in parts was indigenous to the parts beyond the Humber, and on the borders of Yorkshire. Threeman singing may still be heard (not as an exotic), in Wales and the West of England. This last is referred to in the above passage, 'There's scarce a maid westward but she sings it'—viz., the song in three parts.<a id="Page_84" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 84]"></a></p>
<p>Shakespeare is strictly historical in making a pedlar, and two country lasses, capable of 'bearing a part' in a composition of this sort.</p>
<p>The company of 'men of hair,' calling themselves 'Saltiers,' may derive their name from the dance, 'Saltarello.' Gallimaufry is 'Galimathias,' a muddle, or hotch potch. (See <i>Merry Wives</i> II, i, 115).</p>
<p>The threemansong men are more particularly described in <i>Winter's Tale</i> IV, ii, 41.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Clown.</i> She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the <i>shearers; three-man song-men all, and very good ones</i>, but they are <i>most of them means and bases</i>; but <i>one Puritan</i> amongst them, and he <i>sings psalms to hornpipes</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>These musical harvesters square closely with the account given in the <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-0.htm.html#INTRODUCTORY" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Introduction</a>, of music amongst the lower classes. Here were 24 good glee singers, with the single defect that their tenors were very weak, 'most of them means [altos] and basses.' The Puritan was most accommodating, and his singing the words of psalms to the tune of the hornpipe would tend to shew that the Old Adam was not all put away as yet. His compromise with his conscience reminds one of the old stories (all too true) of church singers in the 15th and 16th centuries, who would sing the by no means respectable words of popular<a id="Page_85" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 85]"></a> comic ditties to the solemn strains of the mass 'l'homme armé,' or whatever well-known melody the music happened to be constructed on.</p>
<p>An example of a threemansong will be found in the <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>, 'We be soldiers three.'</p>
<p>Shakespeare also alludes to <i>sacred</i> part-music. Falstaff, by his own account, was a notable singer of Anthems, in which holy service he had lost his voice; he was familiar with members of the celebrated choir of St George's Chapel at Windsor; and was not above practising the metrical Psalmody in his sadder moments.</p>
<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> I, ii, 182.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Chief Justice.</i> Is not your <i>voice broken</i>, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity, and will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</p>

<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> II, i, 88.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Hostess.</i> Thou didst swear to me ... upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a <i>singing-man of Windsor</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Fal.</i> There live not three good men unhanged in England, and one of them is fat, and grows old; God help the while! a bad world, I say. <i>I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This last sentence connects curiously with Sir John Oldcastle, the leader of the Lollards, who were noted for their psalm singing, which indeed gave them the name. These Flemish Protestants, who had fled from the persecutions in their own country, were mostly <i>woollen</i> manufacturers, and were distinguished for their love of Psalmody, throughout the western counties, where they settled. Hence the allusion to 'weavers' and 'Psalms.' But according to the Epilogue of <i>Hen. 4. B.</i>, 'Oldcastle died a martyr, and <i>this is not the man</i>.'</p>
<p>Falstaff knew well what a Ballad was too—as the following shews:—</p>
<p><i>Hen. 4. A.</i> II, ii, 43.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Fal.</i> (to Hal.). Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not <i>ballads made on you all</i>, and <i>sung to filthy tunes</i>, let a cup of sack be my poison.</p>
</div>
<p>Two other worthy knights claim our attention in the next quotation, which contains many interesting allusions. <i>Inter alia</i>; Sir Toby gives Feste sixpence<a id="Page_87" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 87]"></a> to sing a song; Sir Andrew follows it up with a 'testril.' The Clown then sings them 'O mistress mine.' [For the original music see Prof. Bridge's 'Shakespeare Songs,' Novello, a collection which every reader of Shakespeare ought to have. Price 2s. 6d.] Then, at Sir Toby's suggestion, they all three sing a catch, or, in his own words, 'draw <i>three</i> souls out of <i>one</i> weaver,' an allusion to the <i>three</i> vocal parts which are evolved from the <i>one</i> melody of the catch, as well as a sly reference to 'weavers' singing catches. (See <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-0.htm.html#INTRODUCTORY" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Introduction</a>.) They sing 'Thou knave,' for which see the <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>. It is not a good catch, but sounds humorous if done smartly, and perhaps its very roughness suits the circumstances. Next, after Maria's entrance, Toby either quotes the titles, or sings odd lines of four old songs [<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>]; and when Malvolio comes in, furious with the noise they are making in the middle of the night, he applies precisely those epithets to their proceedings that our histories lead us to expect—<i>e.g.</i>, 'gabbling like <i>tinkers</i>,' '<i>alehouse</i>,' squeaking out your '<i>cozier's</i> catches' ['cozier' is 'cobbler']. Sir Toby's puns on 'keep time' in ll. 94 and 115 ought not to be missed. To 'keep time' is almost the only virtue a catch singer <i>must</i> have.<a id="Page_88" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 88]"></a></p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to <i>gabble like tinkers</i> at this time of night? Do ye make an <i>alehouse</i> of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your <i>cozier's catches</i> without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, or <i>time</i> in you?</p>
<p><i>Sir To.</i> <i>We did keep time, sir, in our catches.</i> Sneck up!</p>

<p>L. 103-114, another song, "Farewell, dear heart" [<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>].</p>
<p>It is perhaps necessary to explain the nature of a<a id="Page_90" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 90]"></a> Catch, or Round, more clearly. The two names were interchangeable in the 16th and 17th centuries. It was not till quite modern times that 'Catch' implied a necessary quibble in the words, deliberately arranged by the writer. First, a Catch or Round of the best type of Elizabethan times consisted of <i>one melody</i>, generally perfectly continuous. Secondly, the said melody was always divisible into a certain number of <i>equal sections</i>, varying from three to six, or even eight; and as many sections as there were, so many voices were necessary. Thirdly, each of these equal sections was deliberately arranged so as to make <i>Harmony</i> with every other.</p>
<p>Here are the words of a Round of the 17th century, which is divisible into three equal sections, and therefore is sung by three voices.</p>
