<p>1. 'Cuckoo! Hark! how he sings to us.<br/>
2. Good news the cuckoo brings to us;<br/>
3. Spring is here, says the cuckoo.'<br/></p>
</div>
<p>Now, the way for three persons, A, B, and C, to sing this Catch or Round, is as follows:—</p>
<p>A begins [see above, line 69, '<i>Begin</i>, fool'] line 1, and immediately proceeds to line 2; at this very instant, B in his turn begins line 1, and acts similarly. When A has reached the first syllable in line 3, and<a id="Page_91" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 91]"></a> B is at 'Good' in line 2, it is time for C also to begin at line 1. As soon as A has finished line 3, he begins again; and so on with the others—'round' and 'round' till they are tired of 'catching' each other up.</p>
<p>Thus when they are all three fairly set going, their <i>one</i> melody produces <i>three part</i> harmony, and the catchers have drawn 'three souls out of one weaver.'</p>
<p>The principle in all other Catches or Rounds is exactly the same, however great the number of parts.</p>
<p>In the following we have another case of catch-singing. The original music of 'Flout 'em' has not come down to us.</p>
<p><i>Tempest</i> III, ii, 122.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Stephano.</i> Come on, Trinculo, <i>let us sing</i>.</p>
<p class="c18">[They sing a <i>catch</i>, 'Flout 'em and scout 'em.']</p>
<p><i>Caliban.</i> That's not the tune. [Very likely, as they were tipsy.]</p>
<p class="c18">[<span class="smcap">Ariel</span> <i>plays the tune on a tabor and pipe</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Ste.</i> What is this same?</p>
<p><i>Trin.</i> This is the <i>tune of our catch</i>, played by the picture of Nobody.</p>
<p class="c2">* * * * *</p>
<p>L. 136.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Cal.</i> Be not afeard; the isle is <i>full of noises</i>,<br/>
<span class="c10"><i>Sounds</i>, and <i>sweet airs</i>, that give delight, and hurt not.</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Sometimes a thousand <i>twangling instruments</i></span><br/>
<a id="Page_92" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 92]"></a><span class="c10">Will hum about mine ears; and sometime <i>voices</i>, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><i>Ste.</i> This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I <i>shall have my music for nothing</i>.</p>
<p>L. 152.</p>
<p>I would, I could <i>see</i> this taborer: [Ariel] he <i>lays it on</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Also <i>Id.</i> III, ii, 119.</p>
<p>Stephano, like most of the scamps in Shakespeare, is a good musician. He leads the catch, appreciates Ariel's tabor playing (l. 152), and is overjoyed to think that he will have all his music 'for nothing' (l. 145) in the magical isle.</p>
<p>Finally, in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, we have the title of another old catch, of which the music has survived—viz., 'Jack, boy.'</p>
<p><i>Shrew</i> IV, i, 42.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Curtis.</i> Therefore, good Grumio, the <i>news</i>.</p>
<p><i>Grumio.</i> Why, "<i>Jack, boy! ho, boy!</i>" and as much <i>news</i> as thou wilt.</p>

<p>The words of this catch, which takes four voices, are—</p>

<p>The music [see <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-5.htm.html#APPENDIX" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Appendix</a>], like that of so many<a id="Page_93" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 93]"></a> other catches, is anonymous, and is of some date long before Shakespeare.</p>
<p><i>As You</i> V, iii, 7.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Touchstone.</i> By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a <i>song</i>.</p>
<p><i>2 Page.</i> We are for you; sit i' the middle.</p>
<p><i>1 Page.</i> Shall we <i>clap into 't roundly, without hawking, or spitting</i>, or <i>saying we are hoarse</i>, which are the <i>only prologues to a bad voice</i>?</p>
<p><i>2 Page.</i> I' faith, i' faith; and <i>both in a tune</i>, like two gipsies on a horse.</p>
</div>
<p>[Song follows, 'It was a lover.' Could be sung as a <i>two</i>-part madrigal quite easily. See Bridge's 'Shakespeare Songs,' for Morley's original setting.]</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Touch.</i> Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the <i>note</i> was very <i>untuneable</i>.</p>
<p><i>1 Page.</i> You are deceived, sir; <i>we kept time</i>; we <i>lost not our time</i>.</p>
<p><i>Touch.</i> By my troth, <i>yes</i>; I count it but <i>time lost</i> to hear such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and <i>God mend your voices</i>. Come, Audrey.</p>
</div>
<p>The First Page's speech at l. 9. is most humorously appropriate. 'Both in a tune, like two gipsies on a horse,' is a quaint description of a duet. There is yet another pun on 'lost time' in ll. 36-8.</p>
<p>Jaques' cynicism comes out even in his limited dealings with music.<a id="Page_94" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 94]"></a></p>
<p><i>As You</i> IV, ii, 5.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Jaques.</i> Have you no <i>song</i>, forester, for this purpose?</p>
<p><i>2 Lord.</i> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><i>Jaq.</i> Sing it; <i>'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Song follows, 'What shall he have, that kill'd the deer,' Rimbault, p. 19. Music by Hilton, date about 1600, probably the original setting, a Round for four foresters.</p>
<p>This section will conclude with two quotations about singing of a more serious turn.</p>
<p><i>Tw.</i> II, iv, 1.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Duke.</i> <i>Give me some music.</i>—Now, good morrow, friends.<br/>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Seek him out, and <i>play the tune the while</i>.</p>
<p>L. 20.</p>
<p>[To Cesario]—How dost thou like <i>this tune</i>?</p>
<p><i>Viola.</i> <i>It gives a very echo</i> to the seat<br/>
<span class="c10">Where love is thron'd.</span><br/>

<p><i>Clo.</i> <i>No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.</i></p>
<p><i>Duke.</i> I'll pay thy pleasure then.</p>
</div>
<p>'Light airs' in line 5 means 'vain fiddling jigs'—<i>i.e.</i>, lively instrumental music. Lines 20-22 and 43 are worth remembering for many reasons.</p>
<p>The next and last passage requires no remark, except that 'organ pipe of frailty' means simply the voice of the dying king.</p>
<p><i>King John</i> V, vii, 10. Death of K. John.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00017"><span class="smcap">Serenades and 'Music'</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Serenades is as ancient as that of Songs. In the middle of the 15th century, Sebastian Brant, a lawyer, wrote in Dutch his 'Stultifera Navis,' or 'Ship of Fools,' a severe satire on things in general, and popular amusements in particular. The book was afterwards translated into Latin, and thence into English. Here are some of the verses that treat of Serenades in the year 1450.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

Bereft <i>these vagabonds</i> in their minds, so<br/>

More wildly wandring then either bucke or doe.<br/>
Some with their <i>harpes</i>, another with their <i>lute</i>,<br/>
Another with his <i>bagpipe</i>, or a foolishe <i>flute</i>.<br/>

'But yet moreover these fooles are so unwise,<br/>

When all the houses are lade with snowe and yse,<br/>

<p>Brant had no great opinion of the music provided either. He describes their singing before their lady's window—</p>

<p>Thus, one hundred years before Shakespeare was<a id="Page_98" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 98]"></a> born, Serenades of voices and instruments were common, and in general practice by all classes of young men, and not only laymen, but also yonge fooles of the spiritualtie.</p>
<p>The instruments mentioned are such as were still in use in Shakespeare's time—viz., harp, lute, 'foolish' pipe, bagpipe, and 'foolish' flute, besides the several varieties of song, which evidently included both solo and part singing—'feigned' ballads for a single voice [ballads, that is, in the more refined 'keys' of 'Musica Ficta'], and 'Countering,' which implies that two voices at least took part.</p>
<p>The following passage is an example of this nocturnal serenading by a company of gentlemen.</p>
<p><i>Two Gent.</i> III, ii, 83.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Proteus</i> (advises Thurio)<br/>
<span class="c10">'Visit by night your lady's chamber window</span><br/>
<span class="c10">With some <i>sweet concert</i>: to their <i>instruments</i></span><br/>
<span class="c10">Tune a <i>deploring dump</i>:'</span><br/>
<br/>
<i>Thu.</i> And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.<br/>
<span class="c10">Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Let us into the city presently,</span><br/>
<span class="c10"><i>To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music</i>.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>Proteus advises Thurio to get a 'consort' (probably of viols) to play a 'dump' under Silvia's window.<a id="Page_99" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 99]"></a> He goes to arrange for some of his friends to attend for this purpose. The serenade takes place in the next Act, where, in the 2nd scene, line 17, it is called 'evening music,' but does not include the 'dump,' for Thurio has 'a sonnet that will serve the turn,' so they sing 'Who is Silvia.'</p>
<p>Here is the passage, which is full of quibbles on musical terms.</p>
<p><i>Two Gent.</i> IV, ii, 16.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Proteus.</i> ... 'Now must we to her window,<br/>
<span class="c10">And give <i>some evening music to her ear</i>.'</span><br/>
<br/>
L. 24.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Thu.</i> ... Now, gentlemen,<br/>
<span class="c21">Let's tune.</span><br/></p>
<p>L. 28.</p>
<p><i>Host</i> (to Julia, in boy's clothes). I'll bring you where you shall <i>hear music</i>, and see the gentleman that you ask'd for.</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> But shall I <i>hear him speak</i>?</p>
<p><i>Host.</i> Ay, that you shall.</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> <i>That will be music.</i></p>
<p>L. 54.</p>
<p><i>Host.</i> How do you, man? (<i>i.e.</i>, Julia) the <i>music likes you not</i>.</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> You mistake: the <i>musician</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Proteus) <i>likes me not</i>.<a id="Page_100" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 100]"></a></p>
<p><i>Host.</i> Why, my pretty youth?</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> He <i>plays false</i>, father.</p>
<p><i>Host.</i> How? <i>out of tune on the strings</i>?</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> Not so; but yet <i>so false</i>, that he grieves my very <i>heart-strings</i>.</p>
<p><i>Host.</i> You have a <i>quick ear</i>.</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> Ay; I would I were deaf! it makes me have a <i>slow heart</i>.</p>
<p><i>Host.</i> I perceive, <i>you delight not in music</i>.</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> Not a whit, when it <i>jars</i> so.</p>
<p><i>Host.</i> Hark! what fine <i>change</i> is in the music.</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> Ay, that <i>change</i> (Proteus' unfaithfulness) is the spite.</p>
<p><i>Host</i> (misunderstanding again). You would have them <i>always</i> play but <i>one thing</i>?</p>
<p><i>Jul.</i> I would always have <i>one</i> (Proteus) play but one thing.</p>
<p>L. 85.</p>
<p><i>Silvia</i> (from window). 'I thank you for your music, gentlemen.'</p>
</div>
<p>The next passage is of a serenade in the early morning. Cloten arranges for the musicians (who seem in this case to be professional players) to give two pieces, one instrumental, followed by a song.</p>
<p><i>Cymbeline</i> II, iii, 11. Cloten serenades Imogen.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Cloten.</i> I would this <i>music would come</i>. I am advised to give her <i>music o' mornings</i>; they say, it will penetrate.<a id="Page_101" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 101]"></a></p>
<p class="c8">Enter Musicians.</p>
<p>Come on: <i>tune</i>. If you can penetrate her with your <i>fingering</i>, so; we'll try with <i>tongue</i> too: ... <i>First</i>, a very excellent good-conceited thing; <i>after</i>, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it,—<i>and then</i> let her consider.</p>
<p class="c18">[The musicians perform 'Hark! hark! the lark.']</p>
<p>So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your <i>music the better</i>; if it do not, it is a vice in <i>her ears</i>, which <i>horse-hairs</i>, and <i>calves'-guts</i>, ... can never amend.</p>
</div>
<p>In l. 14, 'fingering' and 'tongue' correspond to 'playing' and 'singing.' The first is to be a 'Fancy' for viols, 'a very excellent good-conceited thing'; the second is the 'wonderful sweet air,' Hark! hark! the lark.</p>
<p>'Good-conceited' means having many 'conceits.' These 'fancies' were always contrapuntal, and the various artificial contrivances, answering of points, imitations, and what not, are referred to under this title. The mention of 'horse-hairs and calves'-guts' makes it clear that the instruments in this 'morning music' were Viols.</p>
<p>Another 'evening music' is provided by Pericles, Prince of Tyre.</p>
<p><i>Pericles</i> II, v, 24. Pericles, a musician [his education had been 'in <i>arts</i> and arms,' see II, iii, 82].<a id="Page_102" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 102]"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">

</div>
<p>The next quotation is also of 'morning music,' but with a different object—not a lady, but a soldier, and of a somewhat rough and ready kind, to judge by the Clown's critical remarks.</p>
<p>The passage seems to indicate the use of Bagpipes; for 'they speak in the <i>nose</i>' (see <i>Merchant</i> IV, i, 48), and are called <i>wind</i>-instruments, and are mentioned under the name 'pipes' in the last two lines. Moreover, there is the remark of the Clown, represented here by stars, which is terribly appropriate to that instrument.</p>
<p><i>Othello</i> III, i. Cassio brings musicians to salute Othello.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Cass.</i> Masters, <i>play here</i>; I will content your pains: Something that's brief; and bid "Good morrow, general."</p>

<p><i>1 Mus.</i> Well, sir, we will not.</p>
<p><i>Clo.</i> If you have <i>any music that may not be heard</i>, to't again; but, as they say, to <i>hear</i> music the general does not greatly care.</p>
<p><i>1 Mus.</i> <i>We have none such</i>, sir.</p>
<p><i>Clo.</i> Then <i>put up your pipes in your bag</i>, for I'll away. Go; vanish into air, away!</p>
</div>
<p>Pandarus appears to be a capital musician. In the following we find him questioning a musical servant of Priam's palace about some instrumental music which is going on within, 'at the request of Paris.' The servant amuses himself by giving 'cross' answers to Pandarus' crooked questions, and in the process gets out two or three musical jokes—<i>e.g.</i>, '<i>partly</i> know,' 'music <i>in parts</i>,' '<i>wholly</i>, sir.' Further on, Paris also plays on the term 'broken' music.</p>
<p><i>Troilus and Cressida</i> III, i, 19.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Pandarus.</i> What music is this?</p>

</div>
<p>The custom of having instrumental music in taverns has already been referred to in the <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-0.htm.html#INTRODUCTORY" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Introduction</a>, near the end, where we learn that the charge for playing before the guests was twenty shillings for two hours in Shakespeare's time; also that a man could hardly go into a public house of entertainment without being followed by two or three itinerant musicians, who would either sing or play for his pleasure, while he was at dinner. Accordingly, we find Sir John Falstaff enjoying such a performance at the Boar's Head, Eastcheap.<a id="Page_105" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 105]"></a></p>
<p><i>H. 4. B.</i> II, iv, 10.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>1 Drawer.</i> Why then, cover, and set them down: and see if thou canst find out <i>Sneak's noise</i>; Mistress Tearsheet would fain have <i>some music</i>. (After supper, in a cooler room.)</p>

</div>
<p>The term 'Sneak's noise' is most interesting. 'Noise' means a company of musicians, and Mr Sneak was the gentleman who gave his name to the particular band of instrumentalists who favoured the Boar's Head.</p>
<p>Milton uses the word, in this sense, in the poem 'At a Solemn Music,' where the 'saintly shout' of the seraphic choir, with 'loud uplifted angel-trumpets,' 'immortal harps of golden wires,' and the singing of psalms and hymns, are collectively called 'that melodious <i>noise</i>.' Also in his Hymn on the Nativity, verse ix., he has 'stringèd <i>noise</i>'—<i>i.e.</i>, band of stringed instruments. The Prayer-book Version (Great Bible) of the Psalms, which was made in 1540, has the word<a id="Page_106" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 106]"></a> in Ps. lxxxi. 1, 'Make a cheerful <i>noise</i> unto the God of Jacob,' and this in the next verses is said to consist of various musical instruments—<i>e.g.</i>, the tabret, harp, lute, and trumpet. Also in the Authorised Version of 1611, Ps. xxxiii. 3, 'play skilfully with a loud <i>noise</i>,' which was the instrumental accompaniment to a 'new song.' The same word is used in several other places, with the meaning of 'music'—<i>e.g.</i>, Pss. lxvi. 1; xcv. 1, 2; xcviii. 4, 6; c. 1; where 'to make a joyful noise' is represented in the original by the same verb, except in one of the two cases in Ps. xcviii. 4.</p>
<p>The word was still in use in 1680, when Dr Plot was present at the annual Bull-running held by the Minstrels of Tutbury, one of the features of which festivity was a banquet, with 'a Noise of musicians playing to them.'</p>
<p>The reputed cure of the Tarantula's bite by music has already been mentioned. The next three examples are of somewhat similar cases.</p>
<p>In the first, Henry IV. in sickness asks for music; the second is an account of Cerimon's attempt to rouse the half-drowned Thaisa with at least partial assistance from music; while the third represents Prospero using a solemn air to remove the magic<a id="Page_107" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 107]"></a> spell which he had cast on Alonso and his other enemies.</p>

<p>Next we have two examples of 'Music at Home.' In the case of the Duke in Twelfth Night, it is<a id="Page_108" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 108]"></a> 'concerted' music, and the players seem to be performing such a quaint old piece as 'The Lord of Salisbury his Pavin,' by Gibbons, in <i>Parthenia</i>, the last 'strain' of which has just such a 'dying fall' as is mentioned in line 4. [See the remarks on the passage from <i>Lucrece</i> in <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-0.htm.html#I" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Section I.</a> on the <i>technical</i> meaning of 'strain.']</p>

<p>Brutus' musical establishment is on a smaller scale than the Duke's. He keeps a 'good boy,' who can sing to his own accompaniment on the lute, and is such a willing servant as to perform when almost overcome by sleep.</p>

<p class="c2">[Song. 'Orpheus.']</p>
<p>The next passage brings us to another class of music—viz., dirges, funeral songs, or 'good-nights.' [See <i>H. 4. B.</i> III, ii, 322]. In <i>Cymbeline</i> IV, ii, 184, Cadwal (Arviragus) sounds an 'ingenious instrument' to signify Imogen's death. Polydore (Guiderius) says<a id="Page_110" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 110]"></a> they had not used it since their mother died. The song, or more properly, duet, which they sing directly after, in memory of Imogen, may be taken in this connection. Unfortunately there seems to be no musical setting of 'Fear no more the heat o' the sun' any older than 1740.</p>
<p>In the following quotation 'dirges' are mentioned by name.</p>
<p><i>Rom.</i> IV, iv, 21.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Capulet.</i> ... "Good faith! 'tis day:<br/>

<span class="c10">Our <i>solemn hymns</i> to <i>sullen dirges</i> change.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>In close connection with these funeral songs is the passage in <i>Hen. VIII.</i> IV, ii, 77, where Queen Katherine, sick, requests her gentleman-usher to get the musicians to play a favourite piece of this class—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="c19">... Good Griffith,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Cause the musicians play me <i>that sad note</i></span><br/>
<span class="c10"><i>I named my knell</i>, whilst I sit meditating</span><br/>
<a id="Page_111" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 111]"></a><span class="c10">On that celestial harmony I go to.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c10">[She sleeps, then, waking from the vision—]</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c14">... Bid the music leave,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">They are harsh and heavy to me.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>It would be of great interest if it were possible to identify Queen Katherine's 'Knell.'</p>
<p>There is an old song, given in Chappell's Popular Music, 'O Death, rock me to sleep,' which might be the very one, for both music and words are singularly appropriate. The Refrain is as follows:—</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>'Tole on thou passing bell<br/>
Ringe out my dolefull <i>knell</i><br/>
Let thy sound my death tell,<br/>
For I must die,<br/>
There is no remedye.'</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The song is most plaintive, and has a very striking feature in the shape of a real independent accompaniment, which keeps up a continual figure of three descending notes, like the bells of a village church. Hawkins gives the poem, with certain variations, and two extra verses at the beginning, the first commencing—</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>'Defiléd is my name full sore,<br/>
Through cruel spite and false report.'</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>and he says the verses are thought to have been written by Anne Boleyn. Hawkins also gives<a id="Page_112" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 112]"></a> music (in four parts) to the first two verses, by Robt. Johnson, a contemporary of Shakespeare's. The music of the song in Chappell is much older than that; indeed, it is very possibly of Hen. VIII.'s time.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00019"><span class="smcap">Dances and Dancing</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Dances is the history of the transition from pure vocal music to pure instrumental music. In the Dances of the 16th century, we have the germs of the modern 'Sonata' Form; and in the association of certain of them we have the first attempt at a sequence of different 'movements,' which finally resulted in the Sonata itself.</p>
<p>The Elizabethan Dances, especially the Pavan, shew us this development just at the point where instrumental music was dividing itself from vocal.</p>
<p><i>All the ancient dances were originally sung.</i> In Grove's Dictionary, Vol. ii. p. 676, there is given the music of a <i>Pavan</i>, in four vocal parts, with the words sung [copied from Arbeau's Orchésographie, 1588]. Morley (Practical Music, 1597) mentions <i>Ballete</i>, as being 'songs which being sung to a dittie may likewise be danced.' Again, he speaks of 'a kind of<a id="Page_114" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 114]"></a> songs ... called Justinianas ... all written in the <i>Bergamasca</i> language.' See <i>Mids. Nt. Dream</i> V, ii, 30, where Bottom is not so very inaccurate after all in asking Duke Theseus to '<i>hear</i> a Bergomask dance between two of our company.' The same author also gives '<i>Passamesos</i> with a dittie [<i>i.e.</i>, sung],' and distinguishes between these aforesaid and 'those kinds which they make <i>without</i> ditties.' [Passamesos are Passing-measures—or Passamezzo—Pavans, see <i>Twelfth Nt.</i> V, i, 200.]</p>
<p>Hence it appears that in Elizabeth's reign some dances were sung, and others were simply played.</p>
<p>Morley goes on to instance two particular dances which were commonly associated together—viz., <i>Pavans</i> and <i>Galliards</i>. [<i>Tw.</i> V, i, 200, I, iii, 127, etc., <i>H. 5.</i> I, ii, 252], the first of which he says is for 'grave' dancing, having three 'strains,' each containing 8, 12, or 16 semibreves (two beats in a bar), which are each repeated; and that this <i>Pavan</i> is usually followed by a <i>Galliard</i>, 'a kind of music made out of the other' [see Bull's Pavan and Galliard, 'St Thomas Wake,' in <i>Parthenia</i>] in <i>triple</i> time, 'a lighter and more stirring dance than the <i>Pavan</i>, and consisting of the same number of straines.'<a id="Page_115" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 115]"></a></p>
<p>The next passage from Morley is very interesting when compared with the stage direction in <i>Timon</i> I, ii, 131, where a <i>masque</i> of <i>Ladies</i> as <i>Amazons</i> enter the banquetting hall at Timon's house, with <i>lutes</i> in their hands, <i>dancing and playing</i>. This stage direction corresponds closely with Morley's account, 'the Italians make their <i>galliards</i> (which they tearm <i>salta relly</i>) plain' [<i>i.e.</i>, alone; not as an appendage to the Pavan, as in England], 'and frame ditties to them, which in their <i>mascaradoes</i> they sing and dance, and manie times without any instruments at all, but instead of instruments they have <i>Curtisans disguised</i> in men's apparell, who sing <i>and daunce</i> to their own songes.'</p>
<p>The 'French <i>bransle</i>,' he says, is like the Alman (Allemagne of Bach, etc.)—<i>i.e.</i>, it 'containeth the time of eight, and most commonly in short notes.' This is the Brawl, see <i>L.L.L.</i> III, i, 9, and was one of several tunes to which the Country Dance was danced, whether in a ring, or 'at length,' like our 'Sir Roger.'</p>
<p>He says that the '<i>voltes</i> and <i>courantes</i>' also are 'like unto this,' but are 'danced after sundrie fashions' [he means, with different steps, but occupying the same rhythmical time, so that the same tune<a id="Page_116" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 116]"></a> would do], 'the <i>volte</i> rising and leaping, the <i>courant</i> travising and running, in which measure also our Countrey dance is made, though it be danced after <i>another form</i> than any of the former.'</p>
<p>'All these be made in <i>straines</i>, either two or three.' See <i>Tw.</i> I, i, 4, 'that <i>strain</i> again,' or <i>Julius Cæsar</i> IV, iii, 258, 'touch thy instrument a <i>strain</i> or two.'</p>
<p>Christopher Sympson, the royalist soldier (1667), confirms Morley's statements as to the constitution and use of these dances. See his 'Compendium,' p. 116, where he expressly states that pure instrumental music, 'made only to delight the ear,' is merely a development from Dances.</p>
<p>He speaks of the association of Pavan and Galliard as being 'in course.' He spells the latter <i>Giliard</i>, and says that it is 'according to its name' [see Skeat, Etym. Dict., Spanish, gallardo (ll = ly), pleasant, gay, lively] 'of a loftly and frolick movement.' Immediately afterwards, however, Sympson seems to forget his own remarks, for he says the name is derived from Gallia, 'the country whence it came.'</p>
<p>On page 117 he speaks of <i>Corants</i>, <i>Sarabands</i>, <i>Jiggs</i>, <i>Country Dances</i>, etc., as 'things so common in each one's ears' that he 'need not enlarge his Discourse' to them.<a id="Page_117" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 117]"></a></p>
<p>There is a capital bit of patriotism on page 118, which deserves quoting, first, because at the time it was entirely justifiable; secondly, because it shews us that in 1667, instrumental music had at last decidedly parted company with vocal part-writing, and had an independent existence. 'You need not seek Outlandish Authors, especially for Instrumental <i>Music</i>; no Nation (in my opinion) being equal to the <i>English</i> in that way; as well for their excellent as their various and numerous Consorts, of 3, 4, 5, and 6 Parts, made properly [on purpose] for Instruments, of all which (as I said) <i>Fancies</i> are the chief.' For 'Consort,' see <i>Two Gent.</i> III, ii, 83; and for 'Fancies,' <i>Hen. IV. B.</i> III, ii, 323.</p>
<p>Hawkins (1776) does not add much of interest to the above account of the Elizabethan dances, except (p. 704) that there is no authority for a Jigg having generally a pointed (<i>i.e.</i>, dotted) note at the beginning of every bar. There is, however, a 'Jegge' given in Stainer and Barrett's Dict. of Musical Terms, dated 1678, where the 'pointed' note is quite characteristic. This may be a more modern feature, for an undoubtedly ancient Jig—viz., Dr Bull's 'King's Hunting Jigg,' not only has no dotted note, but is in common time, without even a tendency towards the rhythm<a id="Page_118" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 118]"></a> of triplets.

<p>Here is a most entertaining quotation from Selden,<a id="FNanchor_19_19"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[19]</a> dealing with fashionable court dances in Elizabeth's reign, and shewing how things had gone from bad to worse in respect of dignity and state in dancing, under the Stuarts.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>'The court of England is much alter'd. At a solemn dancing, <i>first</i> you had the <i>grave measures</i>, <i>then</i> the <i>Corantoes</i> and the <i>Galliards</i>, and <i>this</i> kept up <i>with ceremony</i>; and <i>at length</i> to Trenchmore, and the Cushion dance: <i>Then</i> all the company dances, lord and groom, lady and kitchen-maid, <i>no distinction</i>. So in our court in queen <i>Elizabeth's</i> time, <i>gravity and state</i> were kept up. In king <i>James's</i> time things were <i>pretty well</i>. But <i>in king Charles's time</i>, there has been nothing but Trenchmore and the Cushion-dance, <i>omnium gatherum, tolly polly, hoite cum toite</i>.'</p>
</div>
<p>There are very many passages of interest, containing references to Dances. The first one here given is an instance (in Shakespeare's very text) of singing a dance and dancing to it at the same time. Here the <i>Brawl</i>, and <i>Canary</i>, the first in alphabetical order, are coupled together.</p>
<p><i>L.L.L.</i> III, i, 9.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Moth.</i> Master, will you win your love with a <i>French brawl</i>?<a id="Page_119" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 119]"></a></p>
<p><i>Arm.</i> How meanest thou? <i>brawling in French</i>?</p>
<p><i>Moth.</i> No, my complete master; but to <i>jig off a tune</i> at the tongue's end, <i>canary to it</i> with your feet, ... <i>sigh a note</i>, and <i>sing a note</i>.'</p>
</div>
<p>Two other examples of dancing to one's own singing are, <i>Mids.</i> V, ii, 25 and <i>Wiv.</i> V, v, 93.</p>
<p>The <i>Brawl</i> was written in quick four-in-a-bar time. There are several well-known tunes to it. [See <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-4.htm.html#ORCHESOGRAPHIE" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Note on Arbeau's 'Orchésographie.'</a> 1588.] The derivation of the name is from the French, <i>bransle</i>, a totter, swing, shake, etc., or perhaps from Old French <i>Brandeler</i>, to wag, shake, swing. Skeat thinks the original dance may have been a <i>sword</i> dance, and with this he connects the word Brandish.<a id="FNanchor_20_20"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[20]</a> It was danced, sometimes in a ring, holding hands, and sometimes 'at length.'</p>
<p>The <i>Canary</i> (or Canaries) was in 6/8 time, and was a lively dance. [Stainer and Barrett's Dict. gives one by Delaborde in 4/4 time.] There are many examples by Lully and other Frenchmen of the 17th century. One of Lully's, in Lajarte's 'Airs à Danser,' dates 1666. There is no history of the name. Skeat says<a id="Page_120" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 120]"></a> it is so called from the Canary Islands. Hawkins does not attempt to account for the title, but cunningly infers that it is of English origin because it has <i>not</i> got a foreign name. Also he mentions that Purcell wrote a Canaries for his Opera of Dioclesian, 1690. [See <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@19676@19676-h@19676-h-4.htm.html#ORCHESOGRAPHIE" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Note on 'Orchésographie.'</a>]</p>
<p>The Canary is also alluded to in two other places, where the lively character of the dance is clear. Mr Ford puns on 'wine,' 'pipe,' and 'canary.' Of course <i>he</i> means <i>whine</i>, <i>pipe</i> (for dancing to), and the <i>Canary</i> that he meant Falstaff to dance.</p>
<p><i>Wiv.</i> III, ii, 83.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Host.</i> Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight Falstaff, and drink <i>canary</i> with him.</p>
<p><i>Ford.</i> [<i>aside</i>] I think, I shall drink in <i>pipe-wine</i> first with him; I'll make him <i>dance</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>And next, Lafeu connects the canary with 'spritely fire and motion.'</p>
<p><i>All's Well</i> II, i, 74.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Lafeu.</i> ... I have seen a medicine<br/>
<span class="c10">That's able to breathe life into a stone,</span><br/>
<span class="c10">Quicken a rock, and make you <i>dance canary</i></span><br/>
<span class="c10">With spritely fire and motion.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>There are two specially important passages which mention several dances at one time, so as to give<a id="Page_121" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 121]"></a> some prominence to their special characteristics—viz., <i>Much Ado</i> II, i, 68, and <i>Twelfth Nt.</i> I, iii, 118.</p>
<p>The budget of dances here named includes—</p>
<p>1. Cinque-pace, or Sinkapace. 2. Coranto, or Courante. 3. Galliard. 4. Jig (Scotch). 5. Measure.</p>
<p><i>Much Ado</i> II, i, 68.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Beatrice.</i> The fault will be in the <i>music</i>, cousin, if you be not woo'd <i>in good time</i>: if the prince be too important [importunate], tell him, there is <i>measure</i> in everything, and so <i>dance</i> out the answer. For hear me, Hero; wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a <i>Scotch jig</i>, a <i>measure</i>, and a <i>cinque-pace</i>: the first suit is <i>hot and hasty</i>, like a <i>Scotch jig</i>, and full as fantastical; the wedding, <i>mannerly modest</i>, as a <i>measure</i>, full of <i>state and ancientry</i>; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the <i>cinque-pace faster and faster</i> till he sink into his grave.</p>
