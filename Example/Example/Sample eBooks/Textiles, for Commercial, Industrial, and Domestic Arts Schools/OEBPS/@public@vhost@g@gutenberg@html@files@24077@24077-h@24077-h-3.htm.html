<p><strong>Albatross.</strong> A dress fabric of worsted warp and worsted filling; of open texture and fancy weaves.</p>
<p><strong>Alpaca.</strong> A thin fabric of close texture made from the fibers of an animal of the llama species; mixed with silk or with cotton. It is usually woven with cotton warp and mohair filling. Imitations of all cotton are manufactured and sold under this name.</p>
<p><strong>Corded Alpaca.</strong> Corded weave, lengthwise of the piece, cotton warp alpaca filling; one of the first products of the American loom.</p>
<p><strong>Angora.</strong> The fiber of this goat is commercially known as mohair. The skins are largely used in the making of children’s muffs, for the scalps of dolls, and for trimming coats and capes. Carriage robes also claim a good share of the skins; the hair, being nearly one foot in length, makes them beautiful and serviceable. The fiber enters largely into that class of goods known as Astrakhan, Crepons, Plushes, Brilliantines, Zibelines, fine Cashmeres, and many other fabrics usually sold as all wool or worsted, according to the <a id="Page_84" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 84]"></a> mode of preparing the stock before spinning into yarn. It is found in the finest of silk and worsted fabrics for ladies’ wear, also in linings, mittens, and fine cloaking and overcoating. It is noted especially for its water repelling qualities, its beauty, and high luster; and not so much for its warmth-retaining properties, for which wool stands unequalled.</p>
<p><strong>Astrakhan.</strong> A fabric manufactured from Astrakhan fiber; of a curly, wavy surface applied to a curly faced cloth resembling Astrakhan fleece.</p>
<p><strong>Bandanna.</strong> From the Indian <i>bandanna</i>, to bind or tie. In dyeing, the cloth is tied in knots when dipped, and thus has a clouded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Beaver.</strong> A heavy cloth manufactured of fine wool, with a finish on the surface to resemble the fur of the animal by that name.</p>
<p><strong>Fur Beaver.</strong> Similar in many respects to Beaver, but having on its surface a long, dense nap, in imitation of the fur of the Beaver. Used for overcoats, cloaks, and capes.</p>
<p><strong>Bedford Cord.</strong> A fine woolen fabric, with fine recesses running with the piece, and extensively used for ladies’ dress goods. An all wool cloth of close texture for gentlemen’s clothing. The recesses may also be made with fine cotton yarn hidden in the wool filling.</p>
<p><strong>Beige.</strong> Cloth of undyed or natural wool. The name is the French word for “natural.”</p>
<p><strong>Bindings.</strong> A species of narrow fabric of silk, worsted or cotton, for binding the edges of garments, the bottom of dress skirts, etc.</p>
<p><a id="Page_85" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 85]"></a> <strong>Bombazine.</strong> A twilled fabric of which the warp is silk and the filling is worsted.</p>
<p><strong>Bottany.</strong> A term applied to worsted yarns made from bottany wool. It is considered the finest of all worsted yarns, and is used for fine fabrics of close texture.</p>
<p><strong>Boucle.</strong> Curled hair or wool woven in any cloth in such a way as to show the curl makes boucle. The word is French for curl.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcloth.</strong> Broadcloth is a soft, closely woven material with a satin finish. The best qualities are called satin broadcloth.</p>
<p>The origin of broadcloth dates back to early times, the first historical mention of it being made in 1641. In America, among the first products manufactured by the colonial woolen mills were black and colored broadcloths, and these (with satinets) formed the distinctive character of American woolen fabrics at that time. They were honestly made of pure, fine-fibered Saxony wool, and sold as high as $6.50 per yard.</p>
<p>The warp and filling are made of carded wool so that the web (cloth) will shrink or full evenly. The stock is generally dyed in the raw state when used for men’s wear. When taken from the loom it does not have the smooth, lustrous appearance which is its distinctive feature. It is rough and dull colored, with the threads showing plainly. To improve its appearance it is first subjected to the action of the fulling mill, with the result that the fibers of the warp and weft become entangled to such an extent that the cloth never unravels. Then the cloth is slightly napped and sheared down close, <a id="Page_86" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 86]"></a> in order to produce a smooth, even surface. Next it is successively wetted, steamed, calendered, and hot pressed for the purpose of bringing out the luster. It is commonly twill woven, but is sometimes plain, finished with a slightly napped and lustrous face. It must have a bright, beaver finish, and be close and felty in the weave.</p>
<p>The broadcloth used for women’s clothing is of a lighter weight and is generally piece dyed. It is used for ladies’ suits, coats, and gentlemen’s evening dress suits, frock coats, and tuxedos. It is expensive; prices range from $1.75 to $3.50 per yard in ladies’ broadcloth, and higher for men. The price depends on the quality of wool used, and uniformity of the nap and perfection of the finish.</p>
<p><strong>Bunting.</strong> A plain even thread weave of mohair, wool, or worsted, used mostly for making flags. The name is from German, <i>bunt</i>, meaning variegated or gay colored.</p>
<p><strong>Caniche.</strong> A name given to curled wool fabric showing the effect of the coat of the caniche, a French dog.</p>
<p><strong>Cashmere.</strong> A cloth made from the hair of the Cashmere goat. The face of the fabric is twilled, the twills being uneven and irregular because of the unevenness of the yarn. Cashmere yarn was first hand spun. The goats are grown for their wool in the vale of Cashmere in the Himalaya Mountains.</p>
<p><strong>All Wool Cashmere.</strong> As no material by this name exists there can be no definition. When the term is used in defining a fabric, it is a delusion and a snare.</p>
<p><a id="Page_87" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 87]"></a> <strong>Cashmere Double.</strong> A cloth having Cashmere twill on one side or face and poplin cord on the reverse.</p>
<p><strong>Cassimere.</strong> The name is a variation of Cashmere. Cassimere, when properly made, is of Cashmere wool. Usually a twill weave.</p>
<p><strong>Castor.</strong> Same as beaver, of a light weight.</p>
<p><strong>Challis.</strong> (Also spelled <i>challie</i>.) A name given to a superior dress fabric of silk and wool first manufactured at Norwich, England, in 1832. In texture the original material was soft, thin, fine, and finished without gloss. When first introduced it ranked among the best and most elegant silk and wool textures manufactured. It was composed of fine materials, and instead of giving it a glossy surface, such as is usually produced from silk and fine wool, the object was to make it without luster. The name is now applied to an extremely light weight summer dress fabric, composed of either cotton or wool, or a mixture of these fabrics. In structure it is both plain woven and figured, the ornamental patterns being produced either in the loom or yarn, dyed or printed. It is not sized. All wool challis does not differ essentially from the old-fashioned muslin delaine. Most challis patterns are copied from the French silks, and this accounts in part for their tasteful designs and artistic effects. French challis is a material similar to the above, though usually characterized by a more glossy finish.</p>
<p><strong>Cheviot.</strong> A descriptive term of somewhat loose application, being used indiscriminately of late years to denote almost any sort of stout woolen cloth finished <a id="Page_88" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 88]"></a> with a rough and shaggy surface. Originally the fabric known as cheviot was woven in England, from the strong, coarse wool of the Cheviot sheep, whence the name.</p>
<p>It is at present a worsted or woolen fabric made of cheviot or “pulled wool,” slightly felted, with a short even nap on the surface and a supple feel. Worsted cheviots, in plain colorings or of fancy effects, are manufactured from combed yarn. Woolen cheviots are made from carded yarn. The greater portion of this class of goods in carded yarns contains little or no new wool in its make-up. Shoddy, mungo, and a liberal mixture of cotton to hold it together, blended in the many colorings, help to cover the deception. Prices range from 50 cents to $3.00. The material is plain or twill woven, and has many of the qualities of serge.</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of cheviot, whatever the grade of cloth, is the finish, of which there are two kinds. One is known as the “rough” finish, and the other as the “close” finish. Real cheviot is a rough-finished fabric, composed of a strong, coarse wool and fulled to a considerable degree. The process of finishing cheviot is simple, and practically the same methods are followed for both the “rough” and the “close” styles. On leaving the loom the cloth is first washed in soap and water to remove any dirt or other foreign matter it may contain. It is then fulled, which consists in shrinking the cloth both in length and breadth, thus rendering the texture heavier and denser. Next it is “gigged” or napped. This is accomplished by passing the face of the matted cloth against a cylinder covered with sharp <a id="Page_89" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 89]"></a> pointed teasels which draw out the fibers from the yarn. This operation is continued until a nap more or less dense is raised over the entire surface.</p>
<p>From the gig the cloth is taken to the shearing machine, the revolving blades of which cut the long, irregular nap down to a uniform level. Sometimes the style of finish called for is that approaching a threadbare cassimere, and in this case great care is necessary to prevent the blades from cutting the yarn. In the rough finish the nap, although sparingly raised, is comparatively long. Having been napped and sheared, the cloth is pressed and carefully examined for defects, then brushed, pressed, and highly steamed. When measured, rolled, and steamed, it is ready for market, and is used mostly for ladies’ and gentlemen’s suitings. The pattern and design are light stripes and checks of small dimensions. Cheviot is a name given to many materials used for suiting.</p>
<p><strong>Chinchilla.</strong> Heavy coating with rough wavy face. The name is Spanish for a fur-bearing animal of the mink species.</p>
<p><strong>Chudah.</strong> Applied to billiard cloth; relates to color. Chudah is the Hindoo name of a bright green cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Corduroy.</strong> Heavy corded cotton material used for servants’ livery. The name is from the French <i>Corde du Roi</i>—king’s cords.</p>
<p><strong>Côte Cheval.</strong> In France corded cloth for riding costumes, such as Bedford cord, is called côte cheval, the application being through <i>cheval</i>, horse; <i>côte</i>, ribbed or lined.</p>
<p><a id="Page_90" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 90]"></a> <strong>Coupure.</strong> Coupure is French for cut through. Coupure or cut cashmere is a cashmere weave showing lines cut through the twills lengthwise of the piece.</p>
<p><strong>Covert.</strong> Heavy twilled cloth in natural undyed shades, used in England for men’s overcoats worn while riding to covert in fox hunting.</p>
<p><strong>Delaine.</strong> From the French “of wool”; applies to the most primitive weave of plain wool yarn. Thirty years ago delaine was the staple dress goods stock. It was made in solid colors.</p>
<p><strong>Diagonal Cheviot.</strong> Same as cheviot, only in the weaving the pattern is marked by zigzag lines or stripes.</p>
<p><strong>Doeskin.</strong> Of the broadcloth range, made with shiny napped face, soft finish, as the pelt of a doe.</p>
<p><strong>Drap d’Été.</strong> A heavy cashmere or double warp merino, with the back teasled or scratched, used mostly for clergymen’s clothing and in lighter weights for women’s dresses. The name is French for “cloth of summer.”</p>
<p><strong>Empress Cloth.</strong> Similar to poplin; made of hard twisted worsted filling and cotton warp. Was made a success in the early seventies of the last century by the Empress Eugenie of France. Empress cloth was a staple in all well-regulated dress goods lines.</p>
<p><strong>Épingline.</strong> A fine corded fabric of wool or silk, showing the cords woven close together and appearing as if lined with a pin point. This application is from <i>épingle</i>, French for pin.</p>
<p><a id="Page_91" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 91]"></a> <strong>Etamine.</strong> French name for bolting or sifting cloth, made of silk for sifting flour; applied to mesh or net weaves in America.</p>
<p><strong>Felt.</strong> Fabric made by rolling or pressing a pulpy mass or mixture of wool into a flat mat. The name is from the process. To felt is to mix and press into shape.</p>
<p><strong>Flannel.</strong> Wales appears to have been the original home of flannel, and history informs us that this was the only textile produced in that country for hundreds of years. It is constructed either of cotton or wool, or of an intermixture of these fibers, and is a coarse-threaded, loosely woven, light-weight fabric, more or less spongy and elastic, with an unfinished, lusterless surface. Generally speaking all grades of plain colored flannel are piece dyed, the soft open texture of the goods permitting the fibers to absorb the dye as readily in the web as in the yarn. Flannels are subjected to several finishing operations, such as fulling, teaseling, pressing, and stretching. Flannels do not require a great deal of fulling. All that is necessary is enough to give a degree of stability and body to the goods.</p>
<p><strong>Dress Flannel.</strong> All wool fabric used chiefly for women’s winter dresses; also called flannel suiting. It has a diversity of qualities, colors, and styles of finish. It is commonly put up in double fold, width from twenty-six to fifty inches.</p>
<p><strong>French Flannel.</strong> A fine, soft twill, woven variety dyed in solid shades, and also printed with patterns after the manner of calico; used for morning gowns, dressing sacques, waists, etc.</p>
<p><a id="Page_92" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 92]"></a> <strong>Shaker Flannel.</strong> A variety of white flannel finished with considerable nap, composed of cotton warp and woolen weft.</p>
<p><strong>Indigo Blue.</strong> A superior all wool grade used in the manufacture of men’s suits and particularly for the uniform of members of the G. A. R.</p>
<p><strong>Mackinaw.</strong> The name applied to an extra heavy blanket-like material used in cold climates by miners and lumbermen for shirts and underwear.</p>
<p><strong>Navy Twilled Flannel.</strong> A heavy all wool variety commonly dyed indigo blue, commonly used in the manufacture of overshirts for out-door laborers, firemen, sailors, and miners.</p>
<p><strong>Silk Warp Flannel.</strong> A high grade, pure variety of flannel woven with a silk warp and a fine woolen weft. It is a very soft, light-weight, loosely woven flannel and runs only in narrow widths, twenty-seven inches. If the finishing process is carried beyond fulling the texture is rendered hard and firm, the cloth thus losing its softness and elasticity. In the teaseling process it is necessary for the nap to be raised only slightly, and this is commonly done in the direction of the grain or twist of the warp. The perfection of a flannel finish lies not in the smooth appearance of the cloth, but in its full, rich softness. Sometimes the nap is sheared, but more often it is pressed down flat upon the face of the cloth. After a thorough drying, and careful examination for defects, the goods are rolled on boards, and are ready for market. It is used for infants’ wear and shawls, for undergarments, bed coverings, and also <a id="Page_93" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 93]"></a> to some extent for outer garments in weights and styles adapted for that purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Flannel.</strong> A very light-weight variety woven of fine, soft wool, smooth finish, bleached pure white.</p>
<p><strong>Florentine.</strong> A heavy twilled mohair fabric for men’s wear which is sold largely to Italy and Spain. The name is from Florence, Italy.</p>
<p><strong>Foule.</strong> A twilled, unsheared cloth; that is, the face appears to be unsinged, and shows the woolly roughness in a slight degree. The cloth when woven in the gray is fulled or shrunken in width by soaking in soapsuds and passing it while wet through holes of different sizes in a steel plate. The name is from <i>fouler</i>, French, to full or shrink.</p>
<p><strong>Frieze.</strong> Frieze is a coarse, heavy cloth with a curly surface and made at first of lamb’s wool. It is now made from coarse grades of wool. It is thick and heavily napped, and is used in the manufacture of warm outer garments, particularly for men’s wear. It was named after the people of Friesland in Holland in the 13th century, and is famous to-day as an Irish fabric. Irish frieze has extraordinary durability, and the fibers are the longest and strongest made. The weave is plain, small twill, or herring bone. When not of a solid color it is usually a mixture, the colors being mixed in the raw state. The wool is dyed in the raw state in mass, then doubled after spinning.</p>
<p><strong>Gloria.</strong> Plain weave of silk and wool, and silk and cotton; first made for umbrella covering. Name means bright.</p>
<p><a id="Page_94" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 94]"></a> <strong>Granada.</strong> Popular weave of mohair, made in coating weight for Spanish trade. Granada is a city in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Grenadine.</strong> Originally a plain, openwork, net-like fabric of silk, mohair, cotton, or wool. We have grenadines in Jacquards and in set patterns. The name is an adaptation of Granada.</p>
<p><strong>Henrietta Cloth.</strong> A twilled cashmere of light weight and high finish, originally made with silk warp and wool filling in Yorkshire, England. The name was given in honor of Henrietta Maria of England, Queen of Charles I. The silk warp, hand-woven fabric was first produced about the year 1660.</p>
<p><strong>Homespun.</strong> A rough, loosely woven material made from coarse yarn. It is soft but rather clumsy. A general term used to designate cloth spun or wrought at home. The homespun of the present day is a woolen fabric in imitation of those fabrics made by hand before the introduction of textile machinery. It is made of a coarse, rough, and uneven thread; usually of plain weave and no felting. It was woven by the early settlers of the Eastern and Southern States. It is now used as woolen suiting for men’s wear and in various kinds of coarse, spongy, shaggy cloth for women’s gowns.</p>
<p><strong>Hop Sacking.</strong> A coarse bagging made commonly of a combination of hemp and jute, used for holding hops during transportation. The name hop sacking is also applied to a variety of woolen dress goods made from different classes of yarn. It is made of carded woolen fabric of the plainest kind. The cloth is <a id="Page_95" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 95]"></a> characterized by an open weave, and a square check-like mesh, the structure being designed to imitate that of the coarse jute bagging. It has very little finish, is usually dyed in solid colors, and is used for women’s and children’s dresses.</p>
<p><strong>Jeans.</strong> Cotton or woolen coarse twilled fabric. In cotton used for linings, in wool for men’s cheap clothing. The name is from a Genoese coin, relating to the price of the cloth; so much for one jean.</p>
<p><strong>Kersey.</strong> A very heavy, felted, satin finish woolen cloth made with the cotton weave or cross twill for face, and cotton weave or four harness satin for back. It was originally made with fine Merino lamb’s wool for face, and somewhat coarser grade for back. The cheaper grades are manufactured from a fine-fibered wool and shoddy, with low grades of shoddy and mungo for back. It is named from an English town, Kersey, where from the eleventh to the fifteenth century a large woolen trade was carried on. The Kersey of early history was a coarse cloth, known under different names, and before knitting was used for stockings. In the construction of Kersey the cloth is woven a few inches wider in the loom (and correspondingly longer) than it is to appear in the finished state. This is done in order that the meshes may be closed up in the fulling mill to insure a covering of threads. Previous to fulling, however, the face of the cloth is gigged to produce a good covering for the threads by forming a light nap, which is fitted in. In the fulling operation, which comes next, the cloth is shrunk to its proper width and density, usually to a degree rendering <a id="Page_96" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 96]"></a> it difficult to see the individual warp and filling threads, so closely are they matted together. Fulling is followed by gigging, and in this process a nap more or less heavy is raised on the face of the goods by means of teasels. The cloth is run through the gig several times and then sheared in order to render the fibers forming the nap short, even, and of uniform length. Great care is exercised in the shearing, as the nap must be cropped quite close and yet not expose the threads or cut the face. The next operation is scouring or steaming, in which live steam is forced through every part of the goods for the purpose of developing the natural luster of the wool. In case the goods are to be piece dyed, the dyeing follows scouring. After steaming, the cloth is thoroughly matted and gigged again, care being taken to avoid stirring up the ground nap. It is then dried and the nap briskly brushed in a steam brusher and laid evenly in one direction. Again the cloth is slightly steamed and primed, face up. The result of this treatment is the production of a texture firm, yet pliable, with a highly lustrous face and one not liable to wear rough or threadbare. Kersey is used for overcoats.</p>
<p><strong>Kerseymere.</strong> Light weight twilled worsted; same derivative of name as Kersey.</p>
<p><strong>Linsey Woolsey.</strong> Coarse cloth of linen and wool used as skirtings by the British peasantry. The name is from the components of the cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Melrose.</strong> Double twilled silk and wool fabric; named for Melrose, a town on the Tweed, in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>Melton.</strong> A thick, heavy woolen fabric with short <a id="Page_97" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 97]"></a> nap, feeling somewhat rough. Meltons are made firm in the loom. The weaves for single cloth meltons are usually plain, and three or four harness twill. For double cloths the plain weave is used, or a weave with a plain face and a one-third weave on the back. All trace of the weave is destroyed in the finishing. The colors usually black or dark blue.</p>
<p><strong>Meltonette.</strong> A cloth of the same general appearance as melton, of light weight, for women’s wear.</p>
<p><strong>Merino.</strong> A fabric woven of the wool of the Merino sheep, twilled on both sides, the twill being uneven. Merino resembles cashmere.</p>
<p><strong>Mohair Brilliantine.</strong> A dress fabric resembling alpaca, of superior quality, and sometimes finished on both sides. The name is from the Arabic <i>mukayyan</i>, cloth of goat’s hair. It is made from the long, silky hair of the Angora goat of Asia Minor, a species which is being introduced into the United States. The fabric has a hard, wiry feel, and if made from the pure material has a high luster. It has cotton warp and luster worsted filling. The weave is plain ground, or with a small Jacquard figure, and when a very lustrous fabric is wanted, the warp yarn is of finer counts than the filling yarn. The warp and filling yarns are dyed previous to weaving. They may be of the same color or different colors. The contrast of colors in connection with the weave gives the fabric a pretty effect. Fabrics made with dyed yarns are usually given a dry finish, that is, simply run through the press and cylinder heated, after which they are rolled and then packed. Those made <a id="Page_98" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 98]"></a> with undyed filling are first scoured, then dyed, after which they are run through a rotary press with fifty or sixty pounds of steam heat. Mohair brilliantine is used for dress goods.</p>
<p><strong>Montagnac</strong> is heavy overcoating. The French <i>montagne</i>, for mountain, is the origin of the name, being for mountain wear.</p>
<p><strong>Orleans.</strong> Cloth of cotton warp and bright wool fulling, made in Orleans, France. Many of the so-called alpacas and mohairs of to-day are Orleans. These fabrics are mostly cross-dyed, that is, fabrics with warp and filling of different shades. After weaving they are cross-dyed or redyed to give solid colors and glacé effects.</p>
<p><strong>Panama Cloth</strong> is a plain weave worsted fabric of no uniform construction or finish. Fabrics sold under this name vary considerably. They are of solid colors, usually piece dyed, and are used for suitings.</p>
<p><strong>Prunella.</strong> From the French <i>prunelle</i>, which means plum, a stout worsted material named from its color, which is a purplish shade similar to that of a ripe plum. The name was originally applied to a kind of lasting of which clergymen’s gowns were made. It is now used to denote a variety of rich, satin-faced worsted cloth employed for women’s dresses. The fibers are worsted. Prunella is dyed either in piece or yarn state and is hand finished.</p>
<p><strong>Sacking.</strong> Plain solid color flannel in special shades for women’s dressing sacks, also applied to a fabric made of hemp for grain sacks.</p>
<p><a id="Page_99" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 99]"></a> <strong>Sanglier.</strong> A plain fabric of wiry worsted or mohair yarn, closely woven, with a rough finished surface. Sanglier is French for wild boar, the hairy, wiry cloth resembling the coat of the animal.</p>
<p><strong>Sebastopol.</strong> A twill-faced cloth named from Sebastopol, the Russian fortified town captured by the English and French in 1855.</p>
<p><strong>Serge.</strong> Under this name are classed a large number of fabrics of twill construction. In weight and texture a modern serge resembles flannel, except that it is twill woven and composed of fine yarn finished with a smoother surface. Serge comes from the Italian word <i>sergea</i>, meaning cloth of wool mixed with silk. Serges are woven of worsted, of silk, or of cotton yarn, and variously dyed, finished, and ornamented, as silk serge, serge suiting, storm serge, mohair serge, etc. Worsted serges of various kinds and degrees have been known since the twelfth century. Worsted serge appears to have come into general use as a material for men’s wear in the sixteenth century. Modern serges vary but little from those made two centuries ago. They are dyed in a great variety of colors. On leaving the loom the cloth is washed and scoured with soap and water to remove the dirt and oil (if these remain the cloth will not take the dye properly). After dyeing, it is passed through a pair of metal rollers under pressure, which renders the surface more regular and even and of a better luster. This process accomplishes more than is required, for it produces a bloom on the surface which will show rain specks when in the garment, if it <a id="Page_100" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 100]"></a> is allowed to remain. This is ordinary serge. In order to make storm serge it is necessary to remove part of the bloom, and to accomplish this the cloth is steamed sufficiently to neutralize the effect of pressing. Steaming deadens the bloom and prevents the effects of rain showing on the cloth. The wearing qualities of serge are good, but it gets a shine easily. It is used for dress goods and suitings. Serge suiting used for men’s clothing is a variety of light, wiry, worsted yarn woven with a flat twill, and dyed black or in shades of blue, fifty-four inches in width. Mohair serge is woven with a cotton warp and a mohair filling, thirty-two inches in width. This is dyed in a variety of colors and largely used as lining material for women’s clothes, men’s coats, and overcoats. Storm serge, designed to withstand exposure to stormy weather, is a coarse variety of worsted dress goods produced in a wide range of colors and qualities. The twill is wider, the texture stouter, and the surface rougher and cleaner than that of ordinary serge. Iridescent serge is a variety of worsted dress goods woven with warp and filling of different colors, causing a shimmering or iridescent effect. Cravenette serge is a fine twilled variety having a firm, closely woven texture, dyed black and in colors, and is used for women’s gowns, men’s summer suits, etc. Serge de Barry is a high-grade dress goods of fine texture, with fine twill, and wiry feel.</p>
<p><strong>Shoddy</strong> is made from old woolen stockings or rags, shredded or picked by hand or machine, to render the yarn suitable for spinning a second time, or to give a <a id="Page_101" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 101]"></a> fiber that can be woven or felted with a wool or cotton warp. The name has come to mean cheap, make-believe.</p>
<p><strong>Sicilian.</strong> Heavy weight cotton warp, mohair filled cloth. Sicilienne, the proper name, was made in the Island of Sicily as a heavy ribbed, all silk fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Sultane.</strong> Twilled cloth of silk and wool; finished in the rough, not singed or sheared. The name is from Sultana, the first wife of the Sultan.</p>
<p><strong>Tamise.</strong> Similar to etamine, with a very close mesh, made first of silk and wool. <i>Tamis</i> is French for sieve.</p>
<p><strong>Tartans.</strong> Plaids of the Scottish clans worn by men in the Highlands of Scotland as a diagonal scarf, fastened on one shoulder and crossing the body. Each clan had a distinctive tartan or plaid. The name was adapted from the French <i>tiretaine</i>, a thin woolen checked cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Thibet.</strong> Heavy, coarse weave of goat’s hair, made by the Thibetans in Asia for men’s wear.</p>
<p><strong>Tricot.</strong> A heavy, compound fabric characterized by a line effect running warp way or filling way of the piece, usually produced with either woolen or worsted yarn. Tricot was originally a name given to fabrics made of woolen yarn or thread by hand knitting, and is the French word meaning knitting. The term was later applied to materials made on a knitting frame and now known as jersey cloth. Since 1840 the name tricot has been applied to finely woven woolen cloth, the weave of which is intended to imitate the face effect of a knitted fabric. The fabric is composed of woolen and worsted fibers, sometimes with cotton warp woven so as to hide <a id="Page_102" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 102]"></a> the cotton in finishing. The tricot line is similar to the rib line in a ribbed cloth except that it is not so pronounced. All tricots are constructed with two sets of warp thread and are characterized by a texture which, while dense, is singularly elastic, in this respect being somewhat similar to heavy jersey cloth. Tricots are commonly dyed in plain colors, and are finished clear so as to show the filling. When intended for trousers they are ornamented with small, neat patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Tweed.</strong> A rough unfinished fabric of soft, open, and flexible texture, of wool or cotton and wool, usually of yarn of two or more shades; originally the product of the weavers on the bank of the river Tweed in Scotland. The face of the cloth presents an unfinished appearance rather than a sharp and clearly defined pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Veiling</strong> includes light weight, usually plain weave fabrics of various constructions; generally made with singed or polished yarns. They are in solid colors. The use is designated by the name.</p>
<p><strong>Venetian.</strong> Venetian cloth has a worsted or cotton warp and worsted filling; named from Venetia, a country around Venice. The warp yarns are firmly twisted, the twist being in the opposite direction to the twist in the filling yarn. Venetian is a trade term of wide application, in use since early times as a descriptive title for various fabrics, textures, and garments. One of the many varieties is a species of twill weaving in which the lines or twills are of a rounded form and arranged in a more or less upright position, hence a closely woven worsted cloth. The name is also applied to other fabrics, as a <a id="Page_103" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 103]"></a> twilled lining fabric woven with a cotton warp and a worsted filling known as Italian cloth. It is dyed in plain colors and is piece or yarn dyed for men. For women’s wear it has light weight and plain colors with mixed effects and closely sheared nap. It is finished smooth so as to show the yarns prominently. Venetian cloth has not so much felting as broadcloth; it shows the weave more, but has the same lustrous finish.</p>
<p><strong>Vigogne</strong> or <strong>Vicuña.</strong> A soft wool cloth of the cheviot order, with teasled face, made from the wool of the vicuña, a South American animal. Vigogne is the French name for the animal.</p>
<p><strong>Vigoureux.</strong> A name applied to a plain or twill mixture, woven of undyed natural wool yarns. The French spinners found that the strongest yarns were those of the undyed wool. Sometimes two or more shades or tones are spun into one thread. The name is French for strong.</p>
<p><strong>Voiles.</strong> Voiles are plain weave worsted fabrics made with hard twisted yarns. As clear a face as possible is secured in finishing, the cloth being singed or sheared closely if the yarns are not made comparatively free from loose fibers before being woven. Voiles are dyed in solid colors, and are used principally for dress goods.</p>
<p><strong>Whipcord.</strong> Hard twisted worsted twills, either solid or mixed colors. The name is from the hard twisted lash of a whip.</p>
<p><strong>Worsted Diagonals</strong> are characterized by prominent weave effects running diagonally across the cloth. The goods are usually of a solid color, and are given a finish <a id="Page_104" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 104]"></a> which brings the weave into prominence. Diagonals are used for suitings.</p>
<p><strong>Unfinished worsted</strong> is a fabric woven with yarn with very little twist in it, and finished so as to make it appear covered with loose fibers, concealing the twill effect. After leaving the loom the cloth is placed in a fulling machine which condenses the fibers, thus increasing the density. It is then passed over hot presses after a slight shearing.</p>
<p><strong>Finished Worsted</strong> is woven with yarn with a considerable twist, and finished in such a way as to show the construction of the cloth clearly. The finishing consists simply of scouring the cloth and not fulling it and then passing it through hot water baths between heavy rolls to remove all the soap. It is then sheared and pressed.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr.</strong> Light worsted yarn, also light weight cotton gingham. Zephyr is Greek for the light west wind.</p>
<p><strong>Zibeline.</strong> A cloth manufactured with Merino lamb’s wool for warp, and a light wool mixed with camel’s hair for filling; or, worsted warp and camel’s hair for filling; or either of the foregoing warps and a mixture of wool, camel’s hair, and fine cashmere for filling. The long cashmere hair spreads over the surface. Used for ladies’ tailor-made coats or suits, according to weight. The name is derived from the Latin word <i>sabellum</i>, meaning sable, and was applied originally to a variety of long-haired fur generally thought to be the same as sable. Zibeline has long hairs on its right side, some grades being almost like fur.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00028">COTTON</h2>
<p><strong>Cotton.</strong> Cotton is the most important vegetable fiber used in spinning. The cotton fiber is a soft, downy substance which grows around the cotton seed. When examined under the microscope it appears as a long twisted cell. Owing to the fact that the cotton-plant yields so readily to the varying conditions of soil and climate, there is a large variety of cottons, each having some peculiarity which is considered enough to place it in a distinct class. An idea of the number of species of the cotton-plant can be obtained from the fact that the United States Department of Agriculture has recorded about one hundred and thirty varieties. The most important varieties are: <i>Gossypium herbaceum</i>, <i>G. arboreum</i>, <i>G. hirsutum</i>, <i>G. barbadense</i>, and <i>G. peruvianum</i>. The botanical name of a plant is divided into two parts: first the family name, followed by the species name.</p>
<p>The <i>Gossypium herbaceum</i> grows from four to six feet in height and bears a yellow flower. The seeds are covered with a short gray down. The fiber it bears is classed as short. It is found in Egypt, Asia Minor, Arabia, India, and China. The short-stapled variety of Egyptian cotton is from this species.</p>
<p><a id="Page_106" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 106]"></a> The <i>G. arboreum</i> when full grown attains a height from fifteen to twenty feet. The seed is covered with a greenish fur and is enveloped in a fine, silky down, yellowish white in color. It is found in Egypt, Arabia, and China.</p>
<p>The <i>G. hirsutum</i> is a shrubby plant, its maximum height being about six feet. The young pods are hairy, and the seeds are numerous and covered with a firmly adhering green down. It is probable that this is the original of the green-seeded cotton which is now cultivated so extensively in the Southern States of America, and which forms the bulk of the supply from that source.</p>
<p>The <i>G. peruvianum</i> is similar to the <i>G. barbadense</i>. The Brazilian and Peru cottons are from this species.</p>
<p>The <i>G. barbadense</i> grows from six to fifteen feet high; its flowers are yellow and its seeds black and smooth, being quite destitute of the hair that distinguishes other members of the species. It is a native of Barbadoes or has been cultivated there for a long time. Cottons of the finest texture belong to this species—Sea Island and Florida cottons—from which our finest yarns are spun, and it is used chiefly in the manufacture of fine lace. The long-stapled Egyptian and several other varieties are said to be from this stock.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Growing Countries.</strong> The most suitable situation for growing cotton is between 35 degrees north and 40 degrees south of the equator. The chief cotton growing countries of the world in order of importance are: United States, India, Egypt, and Brazil. Cotton <a id="Page_107" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 107]"></a> is also grown in the following countries, but in no quantity or quality comparable with the four named above—West Indies, west coast of Africa, Asia Minor, China, and Queensland.</p>
<p>The best soil for growing cotton is a light loam or sandy soil, which receives and retains the heat, and at the same time preserves a good supply of moisture. Cold, damp days are not suitable for its growth, while deep rich soils develop too much leaf and stalk. The best climate for the cultivation of cotton is where frost and snow are of short duration, dews are heavy, and the sun bright, warm, and regular. New soils generally produce the best cotton. The character of the cotton fiber is dependent upon three things, the species of the plant, the nature of the soil, and the locality in which it is grown.</p>
<p><strong>Rough Peruvian.</strong> The nature of this cotton is harsh and wiry and resembles wool so nearly that it is almost exclusively used to mix with woolen fabrics. The staple is rough and generally strong, and is of a springy tendency, <i>i.e.</i>, it does not lie close like American.</p>
<p><strong>East Indian.</strong> India depends upon the monsoon for its moisture, and the success or failure of the crop is decided by that phenomenon of nature. Indian cottons as a rule are coarser and shorter than American cottons. The land is prepared before the breaking of the monsoon, and the planting begins after it. There is not the same care bestowed upon the cultivation of the Indian cotton, nor are such improved methods practised as in America. The ancient routine of past generations <a id="Page_108" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 108]"></a> still persists, and as a consequence the yield per acre is less than one-half that of America. Moreover the acreage planted is only about two-thirds that of America. The better growths of East Indian cotton were once largely used in this country for filling, owing to their good color and cleanliness; but of late years the consumption has steadily decreased, owing chiefly to the increased takings by the Indian mills, also to the exports to China and Japan, and to the preference shown by English spinners for American cotton.</p>
<p><strong>Egyptian Cotton.</strong> Egyptian cotton, on account of its long staple and silky gloss, is imported in considerable quantities. Egyptian is largely used in the manufacture of hosiery, and also for mixing with worsted yarn. Owing to its gloss it is used for mixing with silk, and on account of its strength it is made into the finer sewing threads. Egyptian cotton is sometimes so charged with grease that it has a greasy smell; and to make it workable it is necessary to sprinkle it with whitening. It has been observed that velvets woven (or piled) with Egyptian filling do not finish as well as when picked with yarns made from American cotton, the reason for this being that the greasy nature of the Egyptian cotton fiber often varies in strength, causing different shades in the finished goods. This greasy nature is said to be due to two things: (1) the fertility of the soil; (2) the extent to which the cell walls of the fibers are developed.</p>
<p>In addition to cotton, other crops are grown in Egypt—rice, sugar, beans, barley, onions, etc.—and the <a id="Page_109" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 109]"></a> acreage devoted to cotton is regulated to some extent by the prospects as to which crops are likely to pay best. It is calculated that not more than one-third of the area is usually devoted to cotton.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Island Cotton.</strong> This is the finest growth of cotton, and it commands the highest price. The staple, which is long and silky, varies in length from one and a half to two and a half inches. It is used for making fine muslins, laces, spool cotton, and other fabrics, and is also largely mixed with silk. It is said that this cotton was first introduced into America in 1786 from the Bahama Islands, whither it had been brought from the West Indies. It was first cultivated in Georgia, where it was found that the small islands running along the coast were best adapted for its growth, hence the name “Sea Island.” It was also grown on the uplands of Georgia, but although remaining good, the quality deteriorated. Counts as high as four hundred are occasionally spun in Sea Island cotton.</p>
<p><strong>Other Varieties.</strong> Cotton grown in the Southern States under widely varying conditions of the soil, climate, and care in cultivation, naturally varies in length, strength, and other qualities of staple. Cotton known as “Uplands” or “Boweds” varies in length from three-fourths to one and one-sixteenth inches and is used for filling; this is grown in North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee. Cotton used for twist is grown in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, and the length of the staple varies from one to one and three-sixteenths inches. In <a id="Page_110" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 110]"></a> the swampy and bottom lands in some of the states (notably Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas), cotton is grown with staple ranging from one and one-eighth to one and one-fourth inches. In addition to these, there are especially long stapled growths, known as “Extras,” “Allen Seed,” and “Peelers,” which measure one and three-eighths to one and five-eighths inches. Of late there has been an extensive demand for long-stapled American cotton (one and three-sixteenths to one and one-half inches), owing to the development of fine spinning.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Raising.</strong> Cotton is planted with a machine, which puts it under the ground about one and one-half to two inches. It is not planted as corn is, that is, dropped so far apart, but is planted in a continuous stream. After the cotton comes up out of the ground, when it is about three inches high, it is hoed by ordinary labor with a hoe, and is cut out or, rather, thinned. This is called “chopping out” and is for the purpose of removing the inferior or weak plants until only one strong plant is left. The distance between the plants depends on the nature of the plant, frequently about twelve inches being left between them.</p>
<p><strong>The American Crop.</strong> The first step taken is the preparation of the ground for planting. This begins in the southern part of Texas as early as the middle of January, in Florida about the third week; in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana, about the beginning of February; in Arkansas, Tennessee, and South Carolina from about the middle of February to the <a id="Page_111" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 111]"></a> beginning of March. Actual planting begins according to latitude, principally from the middle of March to the middle of April, and ends in the first half of May. These dates, however, are dependent upon the state of the weather. When the weather is unusually wet the start is late. The plant suffers from the rank growth of grass and weeds, and extra labor is required to keep the fields clean. In abnormally hot weather, especially after rains, the plant sheds its leaves, thus exposing the bolls, which fall off, whereupon replanting becomes necessary. In addition to injuries by the weather the cotton-plant is subject to depredations by insects. Of late years the greatest pest has been the Mexican boll weevil.</p>
<p>The cotton-plant blooms ten or eleven weeks after planting. An early bloom is taken as a sign of good crops. When the crop is an early one, picking may commence in the districts in which it ripens first in the latter half of July; but the usual date is the beginning of August, following on in the various districts in succession until the early part of September. The plant goes on fruiting as long as the weather is mild and open. It finishes in the early regions about the beginning of December, the others following through December and closing in the later regions about the middle of January. Frosts play an important part in the ultimate yield. An early killing frost over the entire belt would curtail the size of the crop by 500,000 bales in a season, as was the case in 1909 when about 32,000,000 acres were planted. Light frosts and late frosts do little harm to the cotton-plant; in fact it is contended that the late <a id="Page_112" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 112]"></a> frosts do much good under certain conditions of the crop, by opening the bolls that otherwise would not open, and thus adding to the quantity of the late pickings. The effect of frost upon the lint so picked is to produce tinged and stained cotton. Early killing frosts occur in some seasons in the early part of November, when much of the yield may be curtailed. When killing frosts occur late in the season, when the fruiting is practically over, it has little or no effect upon the yield except as regards the color.</p>
<p>The ripening of the crop proceeds in three stages, the bolls nearest the ground maturing first, then those around the middle of the plant, and lastly the top crop. Pods half ripe are often forced open and the fiber sent on with good cotton. East Indian is more highly charged with unripe cotton than American. The work of picking is not heavy, but becomes tedious from its sameness. Each hand as he goes to the field is supplied with a large basket and a bag. The basket is left at the head of the cotton row, the bag being suspended from the picker’s shoulder by a strap, and used to hold the cotton as it is plucked from the boll. When the bag is full it is emptied into the basket, and this routine continued throughout the day. Each hand picks from 140 to 180 pounds of cotton per day. The average yield in the South varies from 500 to 600 pounds per acre. Every boll of cotton contains seeds resembling unground coffee; when these have been removed by the gin, there remains about one-third the weight of the boll in clean cotton.</p>
