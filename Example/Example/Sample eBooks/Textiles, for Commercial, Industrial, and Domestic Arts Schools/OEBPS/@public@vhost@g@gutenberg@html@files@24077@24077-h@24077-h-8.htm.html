<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Pick glass, microscope, 2 pine cones, foot-rule.<br/>
Materials: Raw wool, woolen yarn.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, chapter <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-0.htm.html#Page_1" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">i</a>.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00088">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Separate a strand of woolen yarn into fibers. Examine both these fibers and fibers pulled from the raw wool. Would you describe these fibers as coarse or fine?</p>
<p>2. How do the fibers feel to touch?</p>
<p>3. Test the strength of the wool fibers by trying to break them.</p>
<p>4. Measure the length of several fibers.</p>
<p>5. Why was it difficult to straighten the fibers to measure them?</p>
<p>6. Extend the fiber to its full length, then release. How does this prove the fiber to be elastic?</p>
<p>7. Examine the fibers under the microscope. Describe. Notice that the wool fiber is cylindrical in shape. Notice that it is covered with scales which overlap much as do the tiles of a roof or the spines of a pine cone.</p>
<p>8. Hold one pine cone with the spines pointing upward. With the spines of the other pointing downward press the second cone <a id="Page_275" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 275]"></a> down on the first. What happens? Just so the scales or points of the wool fibers hook into one another and interlock. These scales or serrations give to the wool fiber its chief characteristic which is the power of interlocking known as <em>felting</em> or <em>shrinking</em>.</p>
<p>9. See <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-0.htm.html#Page_2" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">2</a>, the drawing of a magnified wool fiber. Make a drawing of a wool fiber.</p>
<p>10. Examine under the microscope a hair from your head. Wool is only a variety of hair. Notice that the scales on the hair lie close to the stem and do not project as in the woolen fiber, hence hair fibers cannot interlock as wool fibers do. The scales lying close to the hair give a smooth surface to the fiber and make luster a characteristic.</p>
<p>11. Compare the wool fiber with hair, noting two differences.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00089">Questions</h4>
<p>1. With what is the wool fiber covered?</p>

<p>1. Pull a mohair fiber from the fleece. Hold it up to the light. Describe the fiber as you see it.</p>
<p>2. Hold a mohair fiber and a wool fiber side by side to the light. Note the differences.</p>
<p>3. Measure several mohair fibers.</p>
<p>4. Examine the mohair fiber under the microscope. The fiber is covered with scales, but they lie close to the fiber and do not project in points as do the scales on the wool fiber, hence mohair will not felt to any degree.</p>
<p><a id="Page_276" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 276]"></a> 5. The Angora goat of Asia Minor furnishes the mohair. This goat is being raised in the western states of the United States now.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00094">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Hold a tuft of cotton fibers tightly between the fingers and thumb of each hand and pull apart with a jerk. What is your judgment of the strength of the <em>staple</em> (fiber)?</p>
<p>2. Loosen gently the fibers of one of the tufts you have pulled apart. What is the feel of cotton? the appearance as you hold it to the light?</p>
<p>3. Detach several fibers one by one. How does the length compare with that of the wool and mohair? Measure and record the length of three fibers.</p>
<p><a id="Page_277" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 277]"></a> 4. How do cotton fibers compare in fineness with wool fibers?</p>
<p>5. Compare the elasticity of cotton with that of wool.</p>
<p>6. Examine the cotton fibers under the microscope. Observe that the enlarged fiber looks like a twisted ribbon. When the fiber was growing it was cylindrical in shape. When ripe the plant drew back its life-giving fluid from the fiber and it collapsed and twisted like a corkscrew. The twist is peculiar to the cotton, being present in no other fiber. The twist makes the cotton fiber suitable for spinning, helping to hold the short fibers together.</p>
<p>7. Read of the cotton plant from <i>Textiles</i>, chapter <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-3.htm.html#Page_105" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">ix</a>.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00097">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Place the cocoon in a small pan of water. Apply heat to the pan until the water boils. The cocoon is placed in hot water to soften the glue which holds the fibers together.</p>
<p>2. Remove the outside loose fibers which cannot be reeled. This tangled silk on the outside of the cocoon is called <em>floss</em>.</p>
<p>3. Brush the finger over the cocoon to find the loose ends. Unwind carefully until you find a continuous end. Wind or <em>reel</em> the silk fiber over a lead pencil.</p>
<p>4. The silk fiber is the most beautiful and perfect of all fibers.</p>
<p>5. Hold the cocoon to the light as you reel. How does the silk fiber compare in fineness with the wool and cotton fibers?</p>
<p>6. The silk fiber is from 1000 to 4000 feet long. Unlike the other fibers the silk fiber is already a thread.</p>
<p>7. How does light effect the silk fiber? When the gum is thoroughly washed off the silk takes on its luster which is its chief characteristic.</p>
<p>8. Break the fiber after you have reeled a small quantity. Notice how the fiber springs back. Extend and release again. What characteristic does this illustrate?</p>
<p>9. Examine the silk fiber under the microscope. Notice that it is round and smooth and resembles a glass rod. It shows what appear to be two fibers united by the gum secreted at the same time that the fiber was formed. Describe the silk fiber as it appears under the microscope.</p>
<p>10. Silk is taken from the reel and twisted into a skein of raw silk and thus exported.</p>
<p>11. The manufacture in the United States begins with raw silk. It is handled here first by the <em>throwster</em> who winds it from the skein and makes different varieties of thread.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00100">Directions</h4>
<p>1. The linen fiber is obtained from the flax plant. Certain fibers, such as flax, jute, and ramie, are obtained from the stem of the plant, hence are known as <em>bast</em> fibers, and flax is the most important bast fiber.</p>
<p>2. It is difficult to separate the flax or linen fiber from the woody part of the stem. The process is called <em>retting</em>, which is really rotting by soaking the stem in water.</p>
<p>3. Before the fibers are entirely free from the woody part of the plant they undergo the processes of beating, breaking, scutching, hackling, etc.</p>
<p>4. Read the account of each process. See <i>Textiles</i>, pages <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_194" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">194</a>, <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_195" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">195</a>.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00103">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Examine the hand cards. Notice that there is a foundation of several layers of leather. Notice that this foundation is covered with staples of steel wire. Notice that the staples are shaped like the letter U with the points turned one way. The covering of the hand cards is called <em>card clothing</em>.</p>
<p>2. Hold one hand card in the left hand, face up, wires pointing to the left. Spread the wool over the pointed wires of this card.</p>
<p>3. Hold the other card in the right hand, face down, with the wires pointing to the right. Bring the pointed wires of this card down on the wool and drag it lightly through the wires of the other card. Repeat several times.</p>
<p>4. You have been <em>carding</em> wool. The sharp points have been tearing the wool apart or disentangling the fibers. Carding brushes the fibers out smooth and makes them somewhat parallel. It forms them into a thin sheet.</p>
<p>5. The wool must be carded many times before it is sufficiently disentangled for drawing and spinning. In order to card again the hand card must be <em>stripped</em> of the wool so that it may be dragged again through the staples.</p>
<p>6. Hold the hand card, which is in your right hand, erect. Notice that the wires point downward. Move the other hand <a id="Page_281" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 281]"></a> downward over the wires. Notice that the surface is smooth. The points do not prick as they will if you try to brush the hand upwards over the wires.</p>
<p>7. Hold the card in the left hand in a similar position. Raise and bring the sharp wires of this card down on the smooth surface of the other card and strip it of its wool.</p>
<p>8. Card again, then strip again. Repeat several times until the fibers are thoroughly disentangled.</p>
<p>9. This carding and stripping, once done by hand, is now done in the mill by a power machine called the <em>card</em>. (See picture, <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-1.htm.html#Page_38" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">38</a>.) Notice that instead of cards this machine consists of rollers or cylinders. Some are carding cylinders and some are stripping cylinders. The principle is the same as that of the hand cards. The wool is carded and stripped again and again and is finally delivered in a soft, fluffy rope called a <em>sliver</em> ready for drawing and spinning.</p>

<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Foot-rule, elastic band.<br/>
Material: Small quantity of scoured wool.<br/>

<p><a id="Page_282" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 282]"></a></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00106">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Observe the mass of wool fibers. The wool was clipped from the sheep, <em>washed</em>, and <em>oiled</em> to make it smooth and pliable.</p>
<p>2. With the fingers gently open up or loosen the mass of wool fibers. In the mill this is done by a machine called the <em>card</em>. (See picture, <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-1.htm.html#Page_38" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">38</a>.) And the process itself is called <em>carding</em>.</p>
<p>3. Gently <em>draw</em> out the mass of fibers until you have drawn it into one long strand.</p>
<p>4. Draw it again and again until to draw it would cause it to break.</p>
<p>5. This process in the mill is known as <em>drawing</em>. The wool passes through machine after machine, which gradually reduces the thickness of the strand.</p>
<p>6. You have now a strand called <em>roving</em>, but not a thread with which you could weave. What is called the strand? Why could you not weave with it as it is? If you pulled the roving apart it would separate into a number of small ends. What name is given to these ends?</p>
<p>7. It is necessary to hold these fibers together in a thread. Hold the roving in the left hand and with the right hand draw the fibers out several inches. As you draw, twist the roving between the fingers and thumb. The <em>twisting</em> is called <em>spinning</em>.</p>
<p>8. When you have twisted sufficient yarn to attach to the end of a foot-rule, do so. Give a whirl to the ruler, which is taking the place of the old-time <em>spindle</em>, and let it drop. Continue to whirl the ruler and notice that as it revolves the yarn is twisting. When well twisted, wind the yarn on the ruler. There was a hook on the old-time spindle. Instead of the hook, hold the wound yarn in place by an elastic band. Draw out several inches again and repeat.</p>
<p>9. With the spindle a <em>distaff</em> was used. It held the roving which you now hold in your left hand. (See <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-7.htm.html#Page_254" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">picture</a> of distaff and spindle.)</p>
<p>10. Define spinning; see <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-0.htm.html#Page_4" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">4</a>, footnote. The early use of the spindle was the same as its use of to-day. In what two ways is the spindle of use?</p>
<p>11. The improvement on the distaff and spindle was the spinning wheel. Now the spinning frame in the mill has replaced both.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00108">Experiment 15—Gilling and Combing</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Coarse comb, fine comb.<br/>
Material: Small quantity of scoured wool.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, pages <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-1.htm.html#Page_39" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">39-44</a>.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00109">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Open up the wool a little with the fingers. Do this in place of carding, as you need but a small quantity.</p>
<p>2. You comb your hair to make the hairs lie parallel, side by side, in place. Combs are used on wool for just the same purpose, but the first process of combing is not known as such. It is called <em>gilling</em>, and the combs themselves are called <em>fallers</em>. The machines are known as <em>gill boxes</em>. See <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-1.htm.html#Page_43" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">43</a>.</p>
<p>3. Hold the carded wool in the left hand in the middle of the strand. With the coarse comb in the right hand, comb and thus straighten the fibers first at one end then at the other. This is <em>gilling</em>. The principle of gilling is to comb the fibers more and more nearly parallel and to draw them out into more even strands.</p>
<p>4. The coarse comb causes the hairs to lie parallel. A fine comb will further straighten the hairs, but it will also remove the snarled, tangled, short hairs. Again wool is to be treated like hair. Hold the strand in the middle as before. Comb each end with the fine comb. Notice that the fine comb is removing the short fibers and leaving the long fibers between the fingers. This is the second process of combing, and is called <em>combing</em>.</p>
<p>5. The long fibers are called <em>tops</em> and the short fibers are known <a id="Page_284" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 284]"></a> as <em>noils</em>.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[23]</a> Combing is the process which separates the long fibers known as <em>tops</em> from the short fibers known as <em>noils</em>.</p>
<p>6. The combing machine in the mill is a very complicated one. See picture, <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-1.htm.html#Page_41" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">41</a>.</p>
<p>7. Gill and comb several strands of wool.</p>
<p>8. Top is too delicate, as it comes from the comb, to be handled. The next process is to combine several strands into one. Combine the several strands you have gilled and combed. Comb this one end with the coarse comb again to be sure that the fibers are perfectly parallel.</p>
<p>9. You gilled, combed, and gilled again. So it is in the mill. After combing, the wool is gilled again by machines known as <em>finisher gill boxes</em>, and wound into a ball called <em>a top</em>.</p>
<p>10. <em>A top</em> differs from <em>top</em>. <em>Top</em> is the strand of long fibers which comes from the comb. <em>A top</em> is the ball of combed wool as it comes from the finisher gill boxes. It weighs from 7 to 12 lbs. and contains 200 to 250 yds.</p>
<p>11. The wool is now ready for the next processes—those of drawing and spinning.</p>

Material: Scoured wool.<br/>
Reference: The preceding experiments.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00112">Directions</h4>
<p>1. This wool has already been subjected to the three operations of shearing, scouring, and oiling.</p>
<p>2. Card the wool. What does carding do to the wool?</p>
<p>3. Strip the cards. Rub the sheet of fibers between the palms of the hands into the form of a strand. It is in this form that it leaves the card of the mill, and it is known as a <em>sliver</em> of wool.</p>
<p>4. Pull about three inches of wool from the sliver and perform upon it the operation of gilling by combing it with the coarse comb.</p>
<p>5. Follow the gilling by the operation of <em>combing</em>, which you will do by combing again, this time with a fine comb.</p>
<p>6. Pull about three inches again from the sliver. Continue to gill and comb by section until the entire sliver has been gilled and combed.</p>
<p>7. Combine several strands into one and subject the one strand to a second process of gilling to make sure that all fibers are side by side.</p>
<p>8. Gently draw out this strand of combed long fibers known as top. As you draw, spin. As you spin, wind on a lead pencil. The fineness of the yarn depends on the amount of drawing and twisting.</p>
<p>9. What is the source of wool? You began with wool, covering of the sheep’s body, and after subjecting it to a series of operations you have converted it into yarn which is ready for weaving.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00117">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Cloth from the loom is far from being a finished product. It must pass through several processes before it is finished. These processes are known as <em>finishing</em>.</p>
<p>2. What is the feel of this cloth?</p>
<p><a id="Page_287" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 287]"></a> 3. Hold the cloth to the light and look through it. Note the imperfections and chalk them. What defects did you notice?</p>
<p>4. Place the cloth on the desk, face down. Rub the fingers over the back of the cloth. When the fingers locate a knot, raise it with the dissecting needle to be cut off later.</p>
<p>5. Reverse the cloth. Rub the fingers over the face. When a knot is found, force it through to the back with the dissecting needle. All the knots are on one side now. Clip them off with the scissors. This is called <em>burling</em> and is the first process of finishing.</p>
<p>6. Hold the cloth to the light. Notice where an entire filling thread is missing. This is known as a <em>full miss pick</em>. When part of a filling thread is missing it is spoken of as a <em>half miss pick</em>. In general what does a miss pick mean?</p>
<p>7. Unravel a filling thread from the lower edge of the cloth. With it thread a needle and replace the missing pick. Follow the weave closely, using a pick glass as an aid. You are performing the second process of finishing, that of mending.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00119">Experiment 19—Removal of Stains</h3>
<p class="ctext">Material: Stained fabrics.<br/></p>
<p>Textiles are easily stained, therefore it is necessary to know something about the character of stains and the methods of removal. Stains may be roughly divided into the following classes:</p>
<div class="list">
<p><i>a.</i> Stains from foods, such as grease and fruit acids.</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Stains from machinery, as wheel grease and oils.</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Blood stains.</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Inks.</p>
<p><i>e.</i> Chemicals, such as acids, alkalies.</p>
</div>
<p>Food stains are usually due either to grease contained in soup, <a id="Page_288" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 288]"></a> meat, milk, etc., or to sugar contained in candies or preserves, or to fruit acids contained in fresh fruits or sauces.</p>
<p>Wheel grease and lubricant stains are obtained from various parts of machines, like elevators, street cars, etc. After the cloth leaves the loom it often contains spots of grease, oil, or dirt stains due to drippings from the loom or overhead machinery. These are removed by means of liquids called solvents that dissolve the stain. Ether is the principal solvent used in the mill to remove small stains.</p>
<p>Very few people realize that vapors of cooked food and fat, unless carried out of a house, will condense and settle on fabrics in the form of a film which collects a great deal of dust. (A bad grease spot usually has a neglected grease spot for a foundation.) In order to break up this film it is necessary to separate the entangled dust. This is performed by some mechanical means, such as shaking and brushing.</p>
<p>The most effective method of removing a stain is to place a circle of absorbent material<a id="FNanchor_24_24"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[24]</a> around the spot to take up the excess of liquid. A white cloth should be placed under the fabric to absorb the solvent and show when the goods are clean. Then apply the solvent with a cloth of the same color and texture (satin is excellent as it does not grow linty) and rub from outside the spot to the center to prevent spreading. It is necessary to rub very carefully as excessive rubbing will remove the nap and change the color. One of the great dangers in removing a stain is that you may spoil the fabric. Therefore great care must be exercised.</p>
<p>The principal solvents are ether, chloroform, alcohol, turpentine, benzene, and naphtha. Each solvent may be used to best advantage on certain fabrics.</p>
<p>The commercial grades of the solvents often contain impurities <a id="Page_289" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 289]"></a> that leave a brown ring after evaporation. This brown ring is very objectionable. Turpentine is used only in removing stains from coarse fabrics. Chloroform, benzene, and naphtha are used on ordinary silks and linens. Ether and chloroform are used to best advantage in removing stains from delicate silk, as they seldom affect colors and evaporate very quickly. Of course it must be borne in mind that when a stain is removed from a fabric that portion that contained the stain loses some coloring matter and feels rougher than the other part.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00120">Grease Spots on Heavy Goods that cannot be Laundered</h4>
<p>It is usually desirable to use the following method in removing grease from a heavy fabric, such as carpets or colored fabrics. In case the grease is fresh, place over the stain a piece of clean blotting paper or a piece of butcher’s brown wrapping paper and underneath absorbent paper or oil cloth, and then press the spot with a warm iron. As heat often affects the shades of certain colors such as blues, greens, and reds, it is best to hold a hot iron over the fabric and see if the grease is melted.</p>
<p>Remove a stain from a piece of carpet.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00121">Removal of Grease and Blood</h4>
<p><i>Ordinary Fabrics (wash goods).</i> Wash the fabric containing grease or blood stain with tepid water and soap.</p>
<p><i>Delicate Fabrics.</i> As strong soap will spoil some colors and textures it is necessary to apply a solvent when a delicate fabric is stained.</p>
<p>Remove stains from a washable fabric and a delicate fabric.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00122">Removal of Wheel Grease and Lubricants on Fine Fabrics</h4>
<p>Wheel grease is a mixture of oils and graphite. Apply benzene to the wheel grease spot. This will dissolve the oil, leaving the coloring matter (graphite) on the cloth, and this may be collected on the white cloth on the other side.</p>
<p>Remove a wheel grease stain from a dress fabric.</p>
<p><a id="Page_290" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 290]"></a></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00123">Removal of Acids</h4>
<p>Fruit acids and all others, except nitric acid may be removed by putting ammonia on the spot. This will neutralize the acid, forming a salt which may be either brushed or washed off. In the case of nitric acid the fibers of the cloth are actually destroyed and no amount of ammonia will restore the original condition of the fabric.</p>
<p>Remove a stain of orange juice from a dress or shirt waist.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00124">Removal of Blood</h4>
<p>Blood stains may be removed from a fabric by washing with cold or tepid water. Never use hot water, as hot water coagulates the albumen of the blood. After removing the blood soap and warm water may be used. In case the fabric is a thick cloth, the blood may be removed by applications of moist starch.</p>
<p>Take different samples of fabrics and soil them with fruit acids, soup, wheel grease, ink, and blood and remove them. Exercise great care so as not to leave a mark or remove the coloring.</p>
