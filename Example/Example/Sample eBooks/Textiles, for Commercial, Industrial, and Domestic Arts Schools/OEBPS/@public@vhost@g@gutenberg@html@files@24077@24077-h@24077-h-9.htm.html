<p>Unravel threads of the suspected sample, and with a blade of pen knife note whether the dyestuff has penetrated through the yarn as noted by the depth of color in the interior of the yarn. In case there is the same depth of color in the interior as on the surface, the fabric is yarn-dyed. If on the other hand, the interior of the yarn is not so highly colored as the exterior, it is piece-dyed.</p>

<p>1. What is meant by yarn-dyed fabric?</p>
<p>2. What is meant by piece-dyed fabric?</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00137">Experiment 25—Test to Distinguish Dyed from Printed Fabrics</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Knife-blade.<br/>
Materials: Cotton fabrics.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-2.htm.html#Page_65" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">65</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Printed fabrics may be distinguished from dyed by observing the back side of the cloth, and noting whether or not the pattern on the face of the cloth penetrates through to the back, or only the outline shows. In case the figure or pattern is on both sides of the fabric, it may be distinguished from the dyed by taking one thread of the suspected sample, and by the means of a knife-blade attempting to scrape off the coloring on the surface of the thread. If the <a id="Page_294" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 294]"></a> dyestuff has penetrated into the interior of the thread, it is <em>not</em> printed.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, printed fabrics are known from dyed fabrics by the fact that the former have the design printed on the face of the cloth. This is called <em>direct printing</em>. The best dyed fabrics are obtained by dyeing in what is called a <em>jig</em>, and the whole fabric is saturated with color. Most, if not all the cloths which you see in the retail dry goods stores which are in plain colors are dyed in the jig. Some of the cheaper qualities of dyed fabrics are padded in a mangle, but there has been a very small quantity of these goods on the market for many years.</p>
<p>Printed fabrics may be made as fast as dyed fabrics; it all depends upon the process by which the goods are converted. Within the past few years great headway has been made in dyeing with what are termed <em>vat</em> colors. Indanthrene is a vat color and a great many mills have used this class of dye successfully in dyeing plain shades. This is what would be termed a <em>fast</em> color in every sense of the word. There are a number of dyestuff makers in Europe who put vat colors on the market, but they all call them by different names. Vat colors have been used with success in printing during the past year or two, especially on shirting fabrics, and these colors are fast to both light and washing. Most direct colors used for printing or dyeing are equally fast to light and washing, but of course they will not stand the test as well as the vat colors mentioned above.</p>
<p>The essential qualities of a good printed fabric are its ability to withstand exposure to light and washing. In printing, of course, a greater variety of desirable styles can be obtained than by dyeing, in fact there are certain popular lines of goods now on the market the effect of the designs of which cannot be obtained in any other way than by printing. At the same time, although the field in designing for dyed fabrics is limited, some very handsome effects can be obtained.</p>
<p>It will not be many years before a large proportion of the printed and dyed fabrics put on the market, both foreign and domestic, will be in the vat colors which, as stated above, are very fast. Even at the present time there are many mills that are using this class of colors entirely, especially the mills which manufacture woven fabrics.</p>
<p><a id="Page_295" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 295]"></a></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00138">Questions</h4>
<p>1. In printed fabrics is the pattern clearly discernible on the back of the cloth?</p>
<p>2. If the fabric is printed on both sides, how may this fact be proved?</p>
<p>3. What is the difference between printed and dyed fabrics?</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00139">Experiment 26—Bleaching by Sulphur Dioxide</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: A quart bottle.<br/>
Material: Sulphur, worsted or silk fabric.<br/></p>
<p>Bleaching powder cannot be used in bleaching animal fibers such as woolen and silk fabrics. It injures the fibers and at the same time leaves them yellow.</p>
<p>Animal fibers are best bleached by immersing in an aqueous solution of sulphurous acid or exposing them to fumes of burning sulphur.</p>
<p>Wet a piece of dyed worsted or silk fabric and hang it in a quart bottle containing fumes of burning sulphur.<a id="FNanchor_26_26"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[26]</a> The fumes of burning sulphur have an affinity for coloring matter—dyestuff. The fumes (called sulphur dioxide) do not in most cases destroy the coloring matter as chlorine does, but simply combine with it to form colorless compounds which can be destroyed. The color can be restored by exposing the bleached fabric to dilute sulphuric acid.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00140">Questions</h4>
<p>1. Why is it necessary that the fabric be moist in order to be bleached by sulphur dioxide fumes?</p>
<p>2. What becomes of the coloring matter?</p>

<p>As yarns used in the manufacture of fabrics are of all degrees of thickness, it became necessary to adopt some method of measuring this thickness. For this purpose yarns are numbered, so that when the number is known an idea of the size of the yarn may be gained. It would seem advisable to number yarns of all kinds <a id="Page_297" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 297]"></a> according to one fixed standard, yet unfortunately this is not done. The methods of counting yarns are many and varied. The usual method is to estimate the yarn number by taking the number of hands of a definite length which make up some given weight. Thus in the worsted yarn, No. 1 is a yarn that has 560 yards to a pound. No. 2 worsted yarn has two times 560 yards to a pound. How many yards in No. 12 worsted yarn? How many yards in No. 20 cotton yarn?</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00145">Experiment 32—Test for Twist in Yarn</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Test dial.<br/>
Material: Piece of yarn.<br/>
References: <i>Textiles</i>, pages <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-4.htm.html#Page_131" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">131-132</a>.<br/></p>
<p>As the amount of twist in yarn determines its strength, it is necessary to know the amount of twist per inch in given yarn. The strength increases up to a certain limit. When this limit is reached, increased twist does not make the thread any stronger. We may also have twist and strength at the expense of bulk. The test consists in finding out the number of turns per inch, and this is done by an arrangement where a certain length of yarn is stretched between two points on a twisting machine and the twist taken out. The number of turns required to take the twist completely out are registered on a dial at the side of the apparatus.</p>
<p>Poor cotton that goes into coarse goods cannot be spun as fine as the finer cotton. The shorter the cotton the more twist is required to spin it, and the more twist that is put into the yarn, the less will be the yardage. Whereas on the finer and longer cotton there will be less twist put into it, and the yarn will be much stronger. Find the twist in different kinds of yarn.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00146">Experiment 33—Determining the Direction of Warp and Filling</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Microscope.<br/>
Materials: Silk, cotton, and woolen fabrics.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_238" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">238</a>.<br/></p>
<p>When one examines a fabric the first thing to do is to determine the direction of the warp and direction of the filling.</p>
<p><a id="Page_298" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 298]"></a> Fabrics with Selvedge.—Examine any fabric with a selvedge and notice that the warp threads run in the same direction as the length (longest side) of the selvedge. What direction will the filling threads bear to the selvedge?</p>
<p>Fabrics with a Nap.—Examine a piece of flannel and notice the direction of the nap. Why will the direction of the nap be the same as the direction of the warp? Remember the way in which the fabric enters the napping machine.</p>
<p>Fabrics Containing Double Threads.—Examine a fabric containing double and single threads and notice that the warp contains the double threads. Why?</p>
<p>Fabrics Containing Cotton and Woolen Yarn.—Examine a fabric containing cotton and woolen threads running in different directions and notice that the cotton threads form the warp. Why?</p>
<p>Another way to tell the warp threads in a fabric is to examine warp and filling threads very closely and notice which set contains the greater twist? Why? See if they are separated at more regular intervals. Why?</p>
<p>Stiffened or Starched Fabrics.—Examine stiffened or starched goods very closely and notice the threads. If only one set can be seen they are the warp threads. The stiffer and straighter threads are found in the warp. Why? The rough and crooked threads are seen in the filling.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00150">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Fabrics are bought and sold by the yard. In order to express the amount of wool or cotton in a fabric the weight in ounces per yard is usually given.</p>
<p>2. In order to find the number of ounces per yard a piece of cloth of definite size, usually about 4 sq. in., is stamped out by means of a die, or cut by means of a tin plate exactly 4 sq. in. (2 in. on the side). This is then weighed on very accurate balances and expressed in grains. Find the weight per yard. Remember 7000 grains equal 1 lb.; 16 oz. equal 1 lb.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00154">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Colored goods and printed fabrics should withstand the action of washing. They require more care than white goods and should be soaked in cold water containing very little soap and no soda. They should be dried in the shade as a very hot sun will fade them. If it is necessary to dry them in the sun be sure that they are dried wrong side out, as direct sunlight fades them about five times as much as reflected light.</p>
<p>2. All colored fabrics should stand mechanical friction as well as the action of soap liquor and the temperature of the washing operation. In order to test the fabric for fastness a piece should be placed in a soap solution similar to that used in the ordinary household, and heated to 131° F. The treatment should be repeated several times.</p>
<p>3. If the color fails to run it is fast to washing.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00155">Questions</h4>
<p>1. Why should more care be exercised in washing colored goods than white?</p>

<p>Stockings, hosiery yarns, corset stuffs, and all fabrics intended to be worn next to the skin must be closely knitted to withstand friction and must not rub off, stain, or run, that is, the dyed materials must not give off their color when worn next to the human epidermis (skin), or in close contact with other articles of clothing, as in the case of underwear.</p>
<p>In order to test two fabrics to see which is the better, it is <a id="Page_301" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 301]"></a> necessary to rub the fabric or yarn on white unstarched cotton fabric.</p>
<p>In comparing the fastness of color of two fabrics it is necessary to have the rubbing equal in all cases.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00162">Directions</h4>
<p>Cover one end of the sample of cloth with a piece of cardboard. Expose the fabric to the sunlight for a number of days and examine the cloth each day and notice whether the part exposed has changed in color when compared with the part covered. Count the number of days it has taken the sunlight to change the color. Does direct sunlight have any effect upon colored fabrics? Which is the most affected by the sun, silk, woolen, or cotton fabrics, dyed with same dyestuff, in the same length of time? Are fabrics changed any sooner by the sun than by the weather?</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00166">Experiment 43—Testing Rubberized Fabrics</h3>
<p class="ctext">Materials: Rubberized fabrics.<br/></p>
<p>A great many rubberized fabrics are used for hospitals, domestic purposes and for clothing. On account of the high price of excellent rubberized fabrics a great many substitutes are placed on the market that are satisfactory to the eye, but have not the wearing qualities for the service they are intended to render.</p>
<p>Strength and Resistance to Scratching.—In order to test a rubberized fabric to see if it has the necessary strength to stand everyday use, see if it is possible to scratch it with the finger nail. Then crease it and crumple it between the hands. Then spread it out very carefully and notice whether there are any broken places. If there are it should be rejected.</p>
<p>Waterproof Qualities.—A rubberized fabric should be waterproof. A sample may be tested by forming a bag with it and filling it with water. Crumple the bag while it is filled with water. Notice whether it cracks or leaks.</p>
<p>Examine various rubberized fabrics and notice whether they are substantial.</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00168">Directions</h4>
<p>One of the most useful tests is to see whether an article is made of wool, cotton, or silk, and if a composition of two or more materials, to estimate the percentage of each. Practical experience can teach one much in this respect, and in many cases inspection is quite insufficient. A more reliable test is to burn a piece of material and notice how it burns.</p>
<p><a id="Page_304" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 304]"></a> Take a sample of a woolen and cotton fabric; separate the warp and filling and untwist one piece of warp and one piece of filling yarn. Burn a piece of untwisted yarn and notice whether it burns slowly and curls up into a black crisp cinder leaving a disagreeable smell, or burns with a flash leaving a light ash behind.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00169">Questions</h4>
<p>1. Describe the burning process.</p>
<p>2. What is the burning test for vegetable fiber?</p>
<p>3. What is the burning test for animal fiber?</p>
<p>Repeat the same experiment, placing the untwisted yarn in sulphuric acid. Apply heat and note the effect.</p>
<p>What is the acid test for vegetable fiber?</p>
<p>What is the acid test for animal fiber?</p>
<p>Examine different fabrics to see whether they contain vegetable or animal fibers.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00170">Experiment 45—Difference between Cotton and Linen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Examine a real linen towel and a cotton towel. Wet your hands and use both towels to dry them. Notice which of the fabrics absorbs the moisture quicker, or which towel dries the hands better.</p>
<p>Compare a cotton table-cloth and a linen table-cloth. Notice that the linen fabric has a natural gloss, a cool, smooth feel, and launders much better than cotton. The cotton fabric on the other hand gives off a fuzz, and irons dull and shapeless.<a id="FNanchor_29_29"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[29]</a></p>
<p>Linen is tough and strong, cool feeling, and has a long fiber. Linen cannot be given a cotton fabric finish.<a id="FNanchor_30_30"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">[30]</a></p>
<p><a id="Page_305" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 305]"></a> Cotton on the other hand has a weak, short fiber, dull, warm, and non-absorbent. After washing, cotton resembles a limp rag while linen retains firmness and stiffness.</p>
<p>Which fabric absorbs the moisture more readily?</p>
<p>What is the difference in appearance between the two fabrics? Between the fibers of the fabrics?</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00171">Experiment 46—Test to Distinguish Artificial Silk from Silk</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Porcelain dish, potassium hydrate.<br/>
Material: Piece of silk fabric.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_240" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">240</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Since silk fabrics, particularly hosiery, are becoming popular, various attempts have been made to produce substitutes for real silk. To test a silk fabric, boil the sample in 4 per cent potassium hydrate solution and note the effect. If it produces a yellow solution it is artificial silk, if colorless it is pure silk.</p>
<p>Another simple way used by some workmen, although unhygienic, is to unravel a few threads of the suspected fabric, place them in the mouth, and masticate them vigorously. Artificial silk will soften under the operation and break up into a mass of pulp. Natural silk will retain its fibrous strength.</p>
<p>Test various samples of cheap “silk” hosiery.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00173">Experiment 48—Test to Distinguish Cotton from Linen</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Fuchsine, ammonia.<br/>
Materials: Cotton and linen fabrics.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_240" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">240</a>.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00174">Directions</h4>
<p>1. On account of the high price of linen various attempts are made to pass cotton off for linen. While it is possible sometimes to detect cotton by rolling the suspected fabric between the thumb and finger, the better way is to stain the fabric with fuchsine. If the fibers of the fabric turn red, and this coloration disappears upon the addition of ammonia, they are cotton; if the red color remains, the fibers are linen. The most reliable test is to examine the fiber under the microscope and note the difference in structure.</p>
<p>2. Test a cheap <em>linen</em> fabric for cotton.</p>
<p>3. When cotton yarn is used to adulterate linen it becomes fuzzy through wear, and when used to adulterate other fabrics, it wears shabby and loses its brightness. Linen is a heavier fabric, and wrinkles much more readily than cotton. It wears better, and has an exquisite freshness that is not found in cotton fabrics.</p>
<p>4. Describe a chemical test for linen.</p>
<p>5. What is the difference in appearance and wearing qualities of cotton and linen?</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00175">Experiment 49—Test of Fabric to Withstand Ironing and Pressing</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Hot iron.<br/>
Materials: Silk, cotton, and woolen fabrics.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00176">Directions</h4>
<p>Place the sample over an ironing board and iron it with hot iron (about 200° F.). Compare the sample immediately with one <a id="Page_307" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 307]"></a> not ironed. Remember that many colors, particularly colored silks, change while they are hot. If the original shade returns when the fabric has cooled, then the fabric is fast to ironing and pressing.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00177">Questions</h4>
<p>1. What is the object of ironing and pressing clothes?</p>
<p>2. Is it a good plan to press clothes often?</p>
<p>3. Is there any difference in the effect of the hot iron on the three kinds of fabrics?</p>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00179">Directions</h4>
<p>1. In addition to withstanding the action of coming in contact with the human skin, fabrics like hosiery, etc., should withstand the excretions of the body.</p>
<p>2. To test a fabric for resistance, place the sample in a bath of dilute acid made by adding one teaspoonful of acetic acid to a quart of water warmed to the temperature of the body, 98.6° F. The fabric should be dipped a number of times, and then dried, without rinsing, between parchment paper.</p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00180">Questions</h4>
<p>1. What is the effect of the acid solution upon the fabrics?</p>
<p>2. Would they necessarily withstand the effect of perspiration, even if they did withstand the acetic acid solution? Why?</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00181">Experiment 51—Test for Determining Dressing</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Magnifying glass, porcelain dish.<br/>
Materials: Various fabrics.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_242" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">242</a>.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00182">Directions</h4>
<p>1. A great many cotton fabrics such as muslin often contain considerable sizing or dressing. In order to examine a fabric <a id="Page_308" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 308]"></a> and determine whether too much dressing has been used, take a small sample of the fabric and crush it in the hand and rub it together, so that the dressing is removed and the quantity employed may be determined. If much dressing has been used, dust will be produced in rubbing. Prick the surface with your finger nail. Notice whether the starch comes off. Then wet your finger and rub it on the cloth and allow it to dry. Does the gloss disappear?</p>
<p>2. Another method is to hold the sample before the light and notice whether you can recognize the dressing. Examine the sample with a magnifying glass (or pick glass) and notice whether the dressing is superficial or penetrates the substance of the fabric.</p>
<p>3. Would you buy low priced cotton goods with a thick gloss and pasty look?</p>
<p>4. Notice the effect (lusterless) of fabrics containing much dressing after washing.</p>
<p>5. A very simple way for telling the amount of loading or weighting in a cotton fabric is to weigh a given sample, then “boil the fabric out in hot water,”—boiling for several hours and then drying it. The difference in weight after drying and before boiling gives the weight of sizing material per sample piece.</p>
<p>6. If mineral loading has been used to a great extent, a large residue is left after burning.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00183">Experiment 52—Testing the Strength of Cloth</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Dynamometer.<br/>
Materials: Various fabrics.<br/>
Reference: <i>Textiles</i>, page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-6.htm.html#Page_237" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">237</a>.<br/></p>
<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00184">Directions</h4>
<p>1. An excellent way to test the strength of a fabric is to place the two thumbs together and press them down on the sample, holding it tight underneath. Then try to break the threads, first in one direction and then in the other. Do they break easily? Notice whether one set is very much stronger than the other.</p>
<p>2. Manufacturers usually test yarn and fabrics by means of an instrument called a dynamometer. In this way one can find out whether a yarn or fabric comes up to the necessary strength, and <a id="Page_309" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 309]"></a> whether it has the required yield or stretch. Both these points are of importance in practical work, for it is essential that the yarn as shown should at least be strong enough to bear the strain of manufacture. The test is made by stretching a hank of yarn between the two hooks of a cloth testing machine. The handle at the side is now turned, so that the lower hook descends and puts a strain on the hank. This strain is increased, and at the same time the pointer moves around the dial, which indicates in pounds the amount of strain. When the threads of the hank begin to break, the strain is released, and the catch at the side keeps the pointer in position until the amount of strain is read on the dial. The distance stretched by the yarn before breakage occurs is shown in inches and fractions of an inch, in the small indicator arranged near the upper hook.</p>
<p>Test different fabrics and yarns.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00185">Experiment 53—Characteristics of a Knitted Fabric</h3>
<p class="ctext">Apparatus: Pick glass.<br/>
Materials: Knitted fabric, woven fabric.<br/>

<h4 class="c24" id="pgepubid00186">Directions</h4>
<p>1. Examine a piece of knitted fabric under the pick glass and notice the construction. How does it differ from weaving? The single thread is formed into rows of loops which hang upon each other, thus giving the knitted fabric its characteristic springiness. Why is hosiery suitable for underwear? Try to obtain the thread of the knitted fabric and reduce the whole to a heap of yarn by cutting it. Is the yarn intact?</p>
<p>2. A knitted fabric may be told from a woven fabric by studying the following sketch. (See page <a class="c19 pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@24077@24077-h@24077-h-9.htm.html#Page_310" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">310</a>.)</p>
<p>Note that the element of stretch or elasticity is wholly lacking in the woven cloth except what lengthwise elasticity may be in the threads themselves. On the other hand, referring to the printed diagram of the knitted fabric it will just as readily be seen that its very structure implies such a corrugation of its individual loops that if distended by force in any direction its tendency is to return to the normal.</p>
<p><a id="Page_310" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 310]"></a> The essential characteristics of good hose are:</p>
