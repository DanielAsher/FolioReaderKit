<p id="id77798" style="margin-top: 2em">in 2002, Gibraltar residents voted overwhelmingly by referendum to
reject any "shared sovereignty" arrangement between the UK and
Spain; the Government of Gibraltar insists on equal participation in
talks between the two countries; Spain disapproves of UK plans to
grant Gibraltar greater autonomy; Mauritius and Seychelles claim the
Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory), and its former
inhabitants since their eviction in 1965; most Chagossians reside in
Mauritius, and in 2001 were granted UK citizenship, where some have
since resettled; in May 2006, the High Court of London reversed the
UK Government's 2004 orders of council that banned habitation on the
islands; UK rejects sovereignty talks requested by Argentina, which
still claims the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia
and the South Sandwich Islands; territorial claim in Antarctica
(British Antarctic Territory) overlaps Argentine claim and partially
overlaps Chilean claim; Iceland, the UK, and Ireland dispute
Denmark's claim that the Faroe Islands' continental shelf extends

<p id="id77804">Introduction ::United States</p>

<p id="id77805" style="margin-top: 4em">Background:</p>

<p id="id77806" style="margin-top: 2em">Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776
and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of
America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and
20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the
nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a
number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences
in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a
northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11
southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an
economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force
lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the
end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most
powerful nation state. Over a span of more than five decades, the
economy has achieved steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,
and rapid advances in technology.</p>

hurricanes along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts; tornadoes
in the Midwest and Southeast; mud slides in California; forest fires
in the west; flooding; permafrost in northern Alaska, a major
impediment to development</p>

<p id="id77855">volcanism: the United States experiences volcanic activity in the
Hawaiian Islands, Western Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and in the
Northern Mariana Islands; both Mauna Loa (elev. 4,170 m, 13,678 ft)
in Hawaii and Mount Rainier (elev. 4,392 m, 14,409 ft) in Washington
have been deemed "Decade Volcanoes" by the International Association
of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of
study due to their explosive history and close proximity to human
populations; Pavlof (elev. 2,519 m, 8,264 ft) is the most active
volcano in Alaska's Aleutian Arc and poses a significant threat to
air travel since the area constitutes a major flight path between
North America and East Asia; St. Helens (elev. 2,549 m, 8,363 ft),
famous for the devastating 1980 eruption, remains active today;
numerous other historically active volcanoes exist, mostly
concentrated in the Aleutian arc and Hawaii; they include: in
Alaska: Aniakchak, Augustine, Chiginagak, Fourpeaked, Iliamna,
Katmai, Kupreanof, Martin, Novarupta, Redoubt, Spurr, Wrangell; in
Hawaii: Trident, Ugashik-Peulik, Ukinrek Maars, Veniaminof; in the
Northern Mariana Islands: Anatahan; and in the Pacific Northwest:
Mount Baker, Mount Hood</p>

<p id="id77856" style="margin-top: 3em">Environment - current issues:</p>

<p id="id77857" style="margin-top: 2em">air pollution resulting in acid rain in both the US and Canada; the
US is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning
of fossil fuels; water pollution from runoff of pesticides and
fertilizers; limited natural fresh water resources in much of the
western part of the country require careful management;
desertification</p>

<p id="id77979" style="margin-top: 7em">Economy ::United States</p>

<p id="id77980" style="margin-top: 4em">Economy - overview:</p>

<p id="id77981" style="margin-top: 2em">The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in
the world, with a per capita GDP of $47,400. In this market-oriented
economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the
decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods
and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business
firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off
surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they
face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than
foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the
forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in
medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has
narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology
largely explains the gradual development of a "two-tier labor
market" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the
professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and
more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage,
and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in
household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The war in
March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the
subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national
resources to the military. Soaring oil prices between 2005 and the
first half of 2008 threatened inflation and unemployment, as higher
gasoline prices ate into consumers' budgets. Imported oil accounts
for about 60% of US consumption. Long-term problems include
inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising
medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and
budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower
economic groups. The merchandise trade deficit reached a record $840
billion in 2008 before shrinking to $506 billion in 2009, and
ramping back up to $630 billion in 2010. The global economic
downturn, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, investment bank failures,
falling home prices, and tight credit pushed the United States into
a recession by mid-2008. GDP contracted until the third quarter of
2009, making this the deepest and longest downturn since the Great
Depression. To help stabilize financial markets, the US Congress
established a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in
October 2008. The government used some of these funds to purchase
equity in US banks and other industrial corporations, much of which
had been returned to the government by early 2011. In January 2009
the US Congress passed and President Barack OBAMA signed a bill
providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus to be used over
10 years - two-thirds on additional spending and one-third on tax
cuts - to create jobs and to help the economy recover. Approximately
two-thirds of these funds were injected into the economy by the end
of 2010. In March 2010, President OBAMA signed a health insurance
reform bill into law that will extend coverage to an additional 32
million American citizens by 2016, through private health insurance
for the general population and Medicaid for the impoverished. In
July 2010, the president signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act, a bill designed to promote financial
stability by protecting consumers from financial abuses, ending
taxpayer bailouts of financial firms, dealing with troubled banks
that are "too big to fail," and improving accountability and
transparency in the financial system - in particular, by requiring
certain financial derivatives to be traded in markets that are
subject to government regulation and oversight. In late 2010, the US
Federal Reserve Bank (The Fed) announced that it would purchase $600
billion worth of US Government bonds by June 2011, in an attempt to
keep interest rates from rising and snuffing out the nascent
recovery.</p>

<p id="id78178" style="margin-top: 4em">@United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges  (Australia-Oceania)</p>

<p id="id78179">Introduction ::United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges</p>

<p id="id78180" style="margin-top: 4em">Background:</p>

<p id="id78181" style="margin-top: 2em">All of the following US Pacific island territories except Midway
Atoll constitute the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge
(NWR) Complex and as such are managed by the Fish and Wildlife
Service of the US Department of the Interior. Midway Atoll NWR has
been included in a Refuge Complex with the Hawaiian Islands NWR and
also designated as part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National
Monument. These remote refuges are the most widespread collection of
marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a
single country's jurisdiction. They sustain many endemic species
including corals, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds, water
birds, land birds, insects, and vegetation not found elsewhere.</p>

<p id="id78182">Baker Island: The US took possession of the island in 1857. Its
guano deposits were mined by US and British companies during the
second half of the 19th century. In 1935, a short-lived attempt at
colonization began on this island but was disrupted by World War II
and thereafter abandoned. The island was established as a NWR in
1974.</p>

<p id="id78183">Howland Island: Discovered by the US early in the 19th century, the
uninhabited atoll was officially claimed by the US in 1857. Both US
and British companies mined for guano deposits until about 1890. In
1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization began on this island,
similar to the effort on nearby Baker Island, but was disrupted by
World War II and thereafter abandoned. The famed American aviatrix
Amelia EARHART disappeared while seeking out Howland Island as a
refueling stop during her 1937 round-the-world flight; Earhart
Light, a day beacon near the middle of the west coast, was named in
her memory. The island was established as a NWR in 1974.</p>

<p id="id78184">Jarvis Island: First discovered by the British in 1821, the
uninhabited island was annexed by the US in 1858 but abandoned in
1879 after tons of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island
in 1889 but never carried out plans for further exploitation. The US
occupied and reclaimed the island in 1935. It was abandoned in 1942
during World War II. The island was established as a NWR in 1974.</p>

<p id="id78185">Johnston Atoll: Both the US and the Kingdom of Hawaii annexed
Johnston Atoll in 1858, but it was the US that mined the guano
deposits until the late 1880s. Johnston and Sand Islands were
designated wildlife refuges in 1926. The US Navy took over the atoll
in 1934. Subsequently, the US Air Force assumed control in 1948. The
site was used for high-altitude nuclear tests in the 1950s and
1960s. Until late in 2000 the atoll was maintained as a storage and
disposal site for chemical weapons. Munitions destruction, cleanup,
and closure of the facility were completed by May 2005. The Fish and
Wildlife Service and the US Air Force are currently discussing
future management options; in the interim, Johnston Atoll and the
three-mile Naval Defensive Sea around it remain under the
jurisdiction and administrative control of the US Air Force.</p>

<p id="id78186">Kingman Reef: The US annexed the reef in 1922. Its sheltered lagoon
served as a way station for flying boats on Hawaii-to-American Samoa
flights during the late 1930s. There are no terrestrial plants on
the reef, which is frequently awash, but it does support abundant
and diverse marine fauna and flora. In 2001, the waters surrounding
the reef out to 12 nm were designated a US NWR.</p>

<p id="id78187">Midway Islands: The US took formal possession of the islands in
1867. The laying of the trans-Pacific cable, which passed through
the islands, brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and
1947, Midway was used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights.
The US naval victory over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was
one of the turning points of World War II. The islands continued to
serve as a naval station until closed in 1993. Today the islands are
a NWR and are the site of the world's largest Laysan albatross
colony.</p>

<p id="id78188">Palmyra Atoll: The Kingdom of Hawaii claimed the atoll in 1862, and
the US included it among the Hawaiian Islands when it annexed the
archipelago in 1898. The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 did not
include Palmyra Atoll, which is now partly privately owned by the
Nature Conservancy with the rest owned by the Federal government and
managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. These organizations are
managing the atoll as a wildlife refuge. The lagoons and surrounding
waters within the 12 nm US territorial seas were transferred to the
US Fish and Wildlife Service and designated as a NWR in January 2001.</p>
