  <body><p id="id86492">Benin<br/>

  Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West<br/>

  African kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became<br/>

  a French Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960,<br/>

  as the Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended<br/>

  in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the<br/>

  establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles.<br/>

  A move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later,<br/>

  free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as<br/>

  president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa<br/>

  from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by<br/>

  elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were<br/>

  alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006<br/>

  and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and<br/>

  independent. YAYI has begun a high profile fight against corruption<br/>

  and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin's economic growth.<br/>

<p id="id86493">Bermuda<br/>

  Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English<br/>

  colonists headed for Virginia. Tourism to the island to escape North<br/>

  American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism<br/>

  continues to be important to the island's economy, although<br/>

  international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has<br/>

  developed into a highly successful offshore financial center.<br/>

  Although a referendum on independence from the UK was soundly<br/>

  defeated in 1995, the present government has reopened debate on the<br/>

  issue.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86494">Bhutan<br/>

  In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu,<br/>

  under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for<br/>

  ceding some border land to British India. Under British influence, a<br/>

  monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed<br/>

  whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal<br/>

  affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs.<br/>

  This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years<br/>

  later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan<br/>

  annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country<br/>

  received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and<br/>

  foreign relations. A refugee issue of over 100,000 Bhutanese in<br/>

  Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven<br/>

  United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)<br/>

  camps. In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the<br/>

  government's draft constitution - which would introduce major<br/>

  democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for<br/>

  its approval. In December 2006, the King abdicated the throne to his<br/>

  son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK, in order to give him experience<br/>

  as head of state before the democratic transition. In early 2007,<br/>

  India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty to allow Bhutan greater<br/>

  autonomy in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu<br/>

  continues to coordinate policy decisions in this area with New<br/>

  Delhi. In July 2007, seven ministers of Bhutan's ten-member cabinet<br/>

  resigned to join the political process, and the cabinet acted as a<br/>

  caretaker regime until democratic elections for seats to the<br/>

  country's first parliament were completed in March 2008. The king<br/>

  ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86495">Bolivia<br/>

  Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,<br/>

  broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history<br/>

  has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups.<br/>

  Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have<br/>

  faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and<br/>

  illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected<br/>

  Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the<br/>

  widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule<br/>

  in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's<br/>

  traditional political class and empower the nation's poor,<br/>

  indigenous majority. However, since taking office, his controversial<br/>

  strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the<br/>

  Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous<br/>

  communities of the eastern lowlands. In December 2009, President<br/>

  MORALES easily won reelection, and his party took control of the<br/>

  legislative branch of the government, which will allow him to<br/>

  continue his process of change.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86496">Bosnia and Herzegovina<br/>

  Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of<br/>

  sovereignty in October 1991 was followed by a declaration of<br/>

  independence from the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a<br/>

  referendum boycotted by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported<br/>

  by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed<br/>

  resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and<br/>

  joining Serb-held areas to form a "Greater Serbia." In March 1994,<br/>

  Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from<br/>

  three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat<br/>

  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in<br/>

  Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed a peace agreement that<br/>

  brought to a halt three years of interethnic civil strife (the final<br/>

  agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Peace<br/>

  Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries<br/>

  and created a multi-ethnic and democratic government charged with<br/>

  conducting foreign, diplomatic, and fiscal policy. Also recognized<br/>

  was a second tier of government composed of two entities roughly<br/>

  equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and<br/>

  Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The<br/>

  Federation and RS governments were charged with overseeing most<br/>

  government functions. The Dayton Accords also established the Office<br/>

  of the High Representative (OHR) to oversee the implementation of<br/>

  the civilian aspects of the agreement. The Peace Implementation<br/>

  Council (PIC) at its conference in Bonn in 1997 also gave the High<br/>

  Representative the authority to impose legislation and remove<br/>

  officials, the so-called "Bonn Powers." In 1995-96, a NATO-led<br/>

  international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in<br/>

  Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the<br/>

  agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization<br/>

  Force (SFOR) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities.<br/>

  European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced SFOR in December<br/>

  2004; their mission is to maintain peace and stability throughout<br/>

  the country. EUFOR's mission changed from peacekeeping to civil<br/>

  policing in October 2007, with its presence reduced from nearly<br/>

  7,000 to less than 2,500 troops. Troop strength at the end of 2009<br/>

  stood at roughly 2,000. In January 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina<br/>

  assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the<br/>

  2010-11 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86497">Botswana<br/>

  Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana<br/>

  adopted its new name upon independence in 1966. Four decades of<br/>

  uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and<br/>

  significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic<br/>

  economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining,<br/>

  dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due<br/>

  to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature<br/>

  preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of<br/>

  HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and<br/>

  comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86498">Bouvet Island<br/>

  This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely<br/>

  covered by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered<br/>

  in 1739 by a French naval officer after whom the island was named.<br/>

  No claim was made until 1825, when the British flag was raised. In<br/>

  1928, the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied<br/>

  the island the previous year. In 1971, Norway designated Bouvet<br/>

  Island and the adjacent territorial waters a nature reserve. Since<br/>

  1977, it has run an automated meteorological station on the island.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86499">Brazil<br/>

  Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule,<br/>

  Brazil gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical<br/>

  system of government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the<br/>

  subsequent proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889.<br/>

  Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until<br/>

  populist leader Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the<br/>

  largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent<br/>

  more than half a century of populist and military government until<br/>

  1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian<br/>

  rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural<br/>

  growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural<br/>

  resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's<br/>

  leading economic power and a regional leader, one of the first in<br/>

  the area to begin an economic recovery. Highly unequal income<br/>

  distribution and crime remain pressing problems. In January 2010,<br/>

  Brazil assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for<br/>

  the 2010-11 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86500">British Indian Ocean Territory<br/>

  Formerly administered as part of the<br/>

  British Crown Colony of Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean<br/>

  Territory (BIOT) was established as an overseas territory of the UK<br/>

  in 1965. A number of the islands of the territory were later<br/>

  transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976.<br/>

  Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups<br/>

  comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of<br/>

  the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support<br/>

  facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Between 1967<br/>

  and 1973, former agricultural workers, earlier residents in the<br/>

  islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius, but also to the<br/>

  Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the<br/>

  establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as<br/>

  compensation for the displaced islanders, known as Chagossians.<br/>

  Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits<br/>

  against the British Government seeking further compensation and the<br/>

  right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007, British court<br/>

  rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004<br/>

  BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the<br/>

  archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia.<br/>

  In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal in the UK,<br/>

  ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower<br/>

  court rulings and finding no right of return for the Chagossians.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86501">British Virgin Islands<br/>

  First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib<br/>

  Indians, the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and<br/>

  then annexed by the English in 1672. The islands were part of the<br/>

  British colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872-1960; they were<br/>

  granted autonomy in 1967. The economy is closely tied to the larger<br/>

  and more populous US Virgin Islands to the west; the US dollar is<br/>

  the legal currency.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86502">Brunei<br/>

  The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th<br/>

  and 17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of<br/>

  northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently<br/>

  entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal<br/>

  succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In<br/>

  1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was<br/>

  achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six<br/>

  centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas<br/>

  fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in Asia.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86503">Bulgaria<br/>

  The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the<br/>

  local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first<br/>

  Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with<br/>

  the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the<br/>

  end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman<br/>

  Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of<br/>

  Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having<br/>

  fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within<br/>

  the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in<br/>

  1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its<br/>

  first multiparty election since World War II and began the<br/>

  contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a<br/>

  market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,<br/>

  and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86504">Burkina Faso<br/>

  Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved<br/>

  independence from France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the<br/>

  1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early<br/>

  1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987<br/>

  military coup and has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's<br/>

  high population density and limited natural resources result in poor<br/>

  economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest<br/>

  in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of<br/>

  several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find<br/>

  employment in neighboring countries.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86505">Burma<br/>

  Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886)<br/>

  and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered<br/>

  as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate,<br/>

  self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was<br/>

  attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to<br/>

  1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and<br/>

  later as political kingpin. In September 1988, the military deposed<br/>

  NE WIN and established a new ruling junta. Despite multiparty<br/>

  legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition<br/>

  party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a<br/>

  landslide victory, the junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader<br/>

  and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under<br/>

  house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in<br/>

  May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest. She was<br/>

  finally released in November 2010. After the ruling junta in August<br/>

  2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices, tens of thousands of<br/>

  Burmese marched in protest, led by prodemocracy activists and<br/>

  Buddhist monks. In late September 2007, the government brutally<br/>

  suppressed the protests, killing at least 13 people and arresting<br/>

  thousands for participating in the demonstrations. Since then, the<br/>

  regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest<br/>

  persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests.<br/>

  Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis which official<br/>

  estimates claimed left over 80,000 dead and 50,000 injured. Despite<br/>

  this tragedy, the junta proceeded with its May constitutional<br/>

  referendum, the first vote in Burma since 1990. Parliamentary<br/>

  elections held in November 2010, considered flawed by many in the<br/>

  international community, saw the junta's Union Solidarity and<br/>

  Development Party garnering over 70 percent of the seats. Parliament<br/>

  is constitutionally mandated to convene within 90 days of the<br/>

  election; the president, two vice presidents, and ministers will be<br/>

  selected at that time.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86506">Burundi<br/>

  Burundi's first democratically elected president was<br/>

  assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office,<br/>

  triggering widespread ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi<br/>

  factions. More than 200,000 Burundians perished during the conflict<br/>

  that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of<br/>

  Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in<br/>

  neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing<br/>

  agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels<br/>

  in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that led to an<br/>

  integrated defense force, established a new constitution in 2005,<br/>

  and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The new government,<br/>

  led by President Pierre NKURUNZIZA, signed a South African brokered<br/>

  ceasefire with the country's last rebel group in September of 2006<br/>

  but still faces many challenges.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86507">Cambodia<br/>

  Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers,<br/>

  descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of<br/>

  Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th<br/>

  centuries. Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam)<br/>

  weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king<br/>

  placed the country under French protection in 1863 and it became<br/>

  part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in<br/>

  World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953.<br/>

  In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge<br/>

  forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At<br/>

  least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships,<br/>

  or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A<br/>

  December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the<br/>

  countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off<br/>

  almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated<br/>

  democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected<br/>

  by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore<br/>

  some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional<br/>

  fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second<br/>

  round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another<br/>

  coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining<br/>

  elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the<br/>

  surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial<br/>

  for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal<br/>

  supported by international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were<br/>

  relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between<br/>

  contending political parties before a coalition government was<br/>

  formed. In October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne<br/>

  and his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him.<br/>

  Local elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, with little of<br/>

  the pre-election violence that preceded prior elections. National<br/>

  elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86508">Cameroon<br/>

  The former French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon<br/>

  merged in 1961 to form the present country. Cameroon has generally<br/>

  enjoyed stability, which has permitted the development of<br/>

  agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry.<br/>

  Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power<br/>

  remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86509">Canada<br/>

  A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada<br/>

  became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the<br/>

  British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has<br/>

  developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across<br/>

  an unfortified border. Canada faces the political challenges of<br/>

  meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care and<br/>

  education services, as well as responding to the particular concerns<br/>

  of predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its<br/>

  diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the<br/>

  environment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86510">Cape Verde<br/>

  The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by<br/>

  the Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a<br/>

  trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and<br/>

  resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following<br/>

  independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with<br/>

  Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained<br/>

  until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues<br/>

  to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments.<br/>

  Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused<br/>

  significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result,<br/>

  Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one.<br/>

  Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86511">Cayman Islands<br/>

  The Cayman Islands were colonized from Jamaica by the<br/>

  British during the 18th and 19th centuries and were administered by<br/>

  Jamaica after 1863. In 1959, the islands became a territory within<br/>

  the Federation of the West Indies. When the Federation dissolved in<br/>

  1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86512">Central African Republic<br/>

  The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari<br/>

  became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960. After<br/>

  three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments<br/>

  - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade.<br/>

  President Ange-Felix PATASSE's civilian government was plagued by<br/>

  unrest, and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by<br/>

  General Francois BOZIZE, who established a transitional government.<br/>

  Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups<br/>

  and the main parties, a wide field of candidates contested the<br/>

  municipal, legislative, and presidential elections held in March and<br/>

  May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president. The<br/>

  government still does not fully control the countryside, where<br/>

  pockets of lawlessness persist. Unrest in the neighboring nations of<br/>

  Chad, Sudan, and the DRC continues to affect stability in the<br/>

  Central African Republic as well.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86513">Chad<br/>

  Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured<br/>

  three decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before<br/>

  a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government<br/>

  eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed<br/>

  presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke<br/>

  out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite<br/>

  several peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In<br/>

  2005, new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing<br/>

  attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in<br/>

  December 2006 and October 2007. Power remains in the hands of an<br/>

  ethnic minority. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a<br/>

  referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won<br/>

  another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns<br/>

  continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a<br/>

  significant rebel threat in early 2008.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86514">Chile<br/>

  Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century,<br/>

  northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Mapuche<br/>

  inhabited central and southern Chile. Although Chile declared its<br/>

  independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not<br/>

  achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile<br/>

  defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It<br/>

  was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche Indians were completely<br/>

  subjugated. After a series of elected governments, a three-year-old<br/>

  Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a<br/>

  military coup led by Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely<br/>

  elected president was installed in 1990. Sound economic policies,<br/>

  maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady<br/>

  growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and have helped secure<br/>

  the country's commitment to democratic and representative<br/>

  government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and<br/>

<p id="id86515">China<br/>

  For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing<br/>

  the rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and<br/>

  early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major<br/>

  famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War<br/>

  II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic<br/>

  socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed<br/>

  strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of<br/>

  millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and<br/>

  other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by<br/>

  2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living<br/>

  standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal<br/>

  choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. China<br/>

  since the early 1990s has increased its global outreach and<br/>

  participation in international organizations.<br/>

<p id="id86516">Christmas Island<br/>

  Named in 1643 for the day of its discovery, the<br/>

  island was annexed and settlement began by the UK in 1888. Phosphate<br/>

  mining began in the 1890s. The UK transferred sovereignty to<br/>

  Australia in 1958. Almost two-thirds of the island has been declared<br/>

  a national park.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86517">Clipperton Island<br/>

  This isolated island was named for John<br/>

  CLIPPERTON, a pirate who made it his hideout early in the 18th<br/>

  century. Annexed by France in 1855, it was seized by Mexico in 1897.<br/>

  Arbitration eventually awarded the island to France, which took<br/>

  possession in 1935.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86518">Cocos (Keeling) Islands<br/>

  There are 27 coral islands in the group.<br/>

  Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they<br/>

  remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978,<br/>

  members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the<br/>

  copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the<br/>

  Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955.<br/>

  The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split<br/>

  between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on<br/>

  Home Island.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86519">Colombia<br/>

  Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from<br/>

  the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and<br/>

  Venezuela). A four-decade long conflict between government forces<br/>

  and anti-government insurgent groups, principally the Revolutionary<br/>

  Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade,<br/>

  escalated during the 1990s. The insurgents lack the military or<br/>

  popular support necessary to overthrow the government and violence<br/>

  has been decreasing since about 2002, but insurgents continue<br/>

  attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are<br/>

  under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. More<br/>

  than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006<br/>

  and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal<br/>

  organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary<br/>

  demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members<br/>

  include some former paramilitaries. The Colombian Government has<br/>

  stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the<br/>

  country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative<br/>

  departments. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence<br/>

  spilling over their borders. In January 2011, Colombia assumed a<br/>

  nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86520">Comoros<br/>

  Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups<br/>

  since gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands<br/>

  of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999,<br/>

  military chief Col. AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup, and<br/>

  helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in<br/>

  which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and<br/>

  each island maintains its own local government. AZALI won the 2002<br/>

  presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected<br/>

  its own president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI<br/>

  was elected to office. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's<br/>

  de-facto secession from the Union, refusing to step down in favor of<br/>

  fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros' other islands held<br/>

  legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially<br/>

  attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and<br/>

  a naval blockade on Anjouan, but in March 2008, AU and Comoran<br/>

  soldiers seized the island. The move was generally welcomed by the<br/>

  island's inhabitants.<br/>

  Established as a Belgian colony in
  1908, the Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but
  its early years were marred by political and social instability.
  Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a
  November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU
  Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU
  retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections,
  as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war,
  touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in
  Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU
  regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by
  Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of
  the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged
  by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops
  from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to
  support KABILA's regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the
  DRC, Congolese armed rebel groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda,
  and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was
  assassinated in January 2001 and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named
  head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in
  negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern
  Congo; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all
  remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a
  government of national unity. A transitional government was set up
  in July 2003. Joseph KABILA as president and four vice presidents
  represented the former government, former rebel groups, the
  political opposition, and civil society. The transitional government
  held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and
  elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and provincial
  legislatures in 2006. The National Assembly was installed in
  September 2006 and KABILA was inaugurated president in December
  2006. Provincial assemblies were constituted in early 2007, and
  elected governors and national senators in January 2007.</p>

<p id="id86522">Congo, Republic of the<br/>

  Upon independence in 1960, the former French<br/>

  region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter<br/>

  century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a<br/>

  democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil<br/>

  war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO,<br/>

  and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest.<br/>

  Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March<br/>

  2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a<br/>

  humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's<br/>

  largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will<br/>

  need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the<br/>

  long term.<br/>

<p id="id86523">Cook Islands<br/>

  Named after Captain COOK, who sighted them in 1770, the<br/>

  islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900,<br/>

  administrative control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965,<br/>

  residents chose self-government in free association with New<br/>

  Zealand. The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand and<br/>

  government deficits are continuing problems.<br/>

<p id="id86524">Coral Sea Islands<br/>

  Scattered over more than three-quarters of a<br/>

  million square kilometers of ocean, the Coral Sea Islands were<br/>

  declared a territory of Australia in 1969. They are uninhabited<br/>

  except for a small meteorological staff on the Willis Islets.<br/>

  Automated weather stations, beacons, and a lighthouse occupy many<br/>

  other islands and reefs.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86525">Costa Rica<br/>

  Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th<br/>

  century, initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved<br/>

  unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, including: disease<br/>

  from mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives,<br/>

  and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement<br/>

  of Cartago was established in the cooler, fertile central highlands.<br/>

  The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In<br/>

  1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces<br/>

  that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later<br/>

  it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this<br/>

  federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica<br/>

  proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th<br/>

  century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the<br/>

  country's democratic development. Although it still maintains a<br/>

  large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to<br/>

  include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of<br/>

  living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.<br/>

<p id="id86526" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Cote d'Ivoire
  Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the
  development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment
  made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African
  states, but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December
  1999, a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history -
  overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged
  elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular
  protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into
  power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military
  launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces
  claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were
  granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the
  auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and
  rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December
  2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the
  civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remained
  unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force
  rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political
  Agreement. As a result of the agreement, SORO joined GBAGBO's
  government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the
  country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from
  South, integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces, and
  hold elections. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of
  rebel forces have been problematic as rebels seek to enter the armed
  forces. Citizen identification and voter registration pose election
  difficulties, and balloting planned for November 2009 was postponed
  with no future date set. Several thousand UN troops and several
  hundred French remain in Cote d'Ivoire to help the parties implement
  their commitments and to support the peace process.</p>

<p id="id86527">Croatia<br/>

  The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the<br/>

  Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the<br/>

  Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as<br/>

  Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal<br/>

  independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO.<br/>

  Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,<br/>

  it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before<br/>

  occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under<br/>

  UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was<br/>

  returned to Croatia in 1998. In April 2009, Croatia joined NATO; it<br/>

  is a candidate for eventual EU accession.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86528">Cuba<br/>

  The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after<br/>

  the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492<br/>

  and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next<br/>

  several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to<br/>

  work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the<br/>

  launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from<br/>

  Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence<br/>

  movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. US<br/>

  intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the<br/>

  Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established<br/>

  Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island<br/>

  experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military<br/>

  and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in<br/>

  1959; his iron rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly<br/>

  five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor<br/>

  of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's Communist revolution,<br/>

  with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and<br/>

  Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country faced a<br/>

  severe economic downturn in 1990 following the withdrawal of former<br/>

  Soviet subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba at<br/>

  times portrays the US embargo, in place since 1961, as the source if<br/>

  its difficulties. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade<br/>

  rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or via the southwest border -<br/>

  is a continuing problem. The US Coast Guard intercepted 982<br/>

  individuals attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in fiscal<br/>

  year 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86529">Curacao<br/>

  Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by<br/>

  the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire. Once<br/>

  the center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit by the<br/>

  abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of<br/>

  neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the<br/>

  construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered<br/>

  Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch<br/>

  Caribbean possesions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles,<br/>

  part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and<br/>

  2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing<br/>

  country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status<br/>

  became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the<br/>

  Netherlands Antilles.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86530">Cyprus<br/>

  A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960<br/>

  following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the<br/>

  Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head<br/>

  in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia.<br/>

  Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic<br/>

  intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into<br/>

  enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek<br/>

  Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by<br/>

  military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a<br/>

  third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area<br/>

  declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"),<br/>

  but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot<br/>

  president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both<br/>

  the Turkish and Cypriot Governments to reopen unification<br/>

  negotiations. In September 2008, the leaders of the Greek Cypriot<br/>

  and Turkish Cypriot communities started negotiations under UN<br/>

  auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. The entire island<br/>

  entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of<br/>

  common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the<br/>

  internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the areas<br/>

  administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish<br/>

  Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus<br/>

  citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens<br/>

  of European Union states.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86531">Czech Republic<br/>

  Following the First World War, the closely related<br/>

  Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to<br/>

  form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's<br/>

  leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of<br/>

  other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the<br/>

  Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II,<br/>

  a truncated Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of<br/>

  influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the<br/>

  efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist party rule<br/>

  and create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations<br/>

  the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the<br/>

  collapse of Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its<br/>

  freedom through a peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993,<br/>

  the country underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national<br/>

  components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic<br/>

  joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86532">Denmark<br/>

  Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north<br/>

  European power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation<br/>

  that is participating in the general political and economic<br/>

  integration of Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the<br/>

  EU) in 1973. However, the country has opted out of certain elements<br/>

  of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European<br/>

  Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and<br/>

  issues concerning certain justice and home affairs.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86533">Dhekelia<br/>

  By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment that created<br/>

  the independent Republic of Cyprus, the UK retained full sovereignty<br/>

  and jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers -<br/>

  Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The larger of these is the Dhekelia Sovereign<br/>

  Base Area, which is also referred to as the Eastern Sovereign Base<br/>

  Area.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86534">Djibouti<br/>

  The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became<br/>

  Djibouti in 1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian<br/>

  one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999.<br/>

  Unrest among the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war<br/>

  that ended in 2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord<br/>

  between Afar rebels and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999,<br/>

  Djibouti's first multi-party presidential elections resulted in the<br/>

  election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second term<br/>

  in 2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the<br/>

  mouth of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment<br/>

  location for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands.<br/>

  The present leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains<br/>

  a significant military presence in the country but also has strong<br/>

  ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base in<br/>

  sub-Saharan Africa and is a front-line state in the global war on<br/>

  terrorism.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86535">Dominica<br/>

  Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be<br/>

  colonized by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the<br/>

  native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763,<br/>

  which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after<br/>

  independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and<br/>

  tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia<br/>

  CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who<br/>

  remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still<br/>

  living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining<br/>

  in the eastern Caribbean.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86536">Dominican Republic<br/>

  Explored and claimed by Christopher COLUMBUS on<br/>

  his first voyage in 1492, the island of Hispaniola became a<br/>

  springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American<br/>

  mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western<br/>

  third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of<br/>

  the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own<br/>

  independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for<br/>

  22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic<br/>

  in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish<br/>

  Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored<br/>

  independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly<br/>

  non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of<br/>

  Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61. Juan BOSCH was elected<br/>

  president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In<br/>

  1965, the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil<br/>

  war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin<br/>

  BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER<br/>

  maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when<br/>

  international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his<br/>

  term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been<br/>

  held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former<br/>

  President (1996-2000) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new<br/>

  term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing<br/>

  presidents to serve more than one term, and was since reelected to a<br/>

  second consecutive term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86537">Ecuador<br/>

  What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire<br/>

  until the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish<br/>

  colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New<br/>

  Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada<br/>

  (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between<br/>

  1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When<br/>

  Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of<br/>

  the "Republic of the Equator." Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost<br/>

  territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border<br/>

  war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although<br/>

  Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period<br/>

  has been marred by political instability. Protests in Quito<br/>

  contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four<br/>

  democratically elected Presidents. In September 2008, voters<br/>

  approved a new constitution; Ecuador's twentieth since gaining<br/>

  independence. General elections, under the new constitutional<br/>

  framework, were held in April 2009, and voters re-elected President<br/>

  Rafael CORREA.<br/>

<p id="id86538">Egypt<br/>

  The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood,<br/>

  coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and<br/>

  west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great<br/>

  civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series<br/>

  of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last<br/>

  native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were<br/>

  replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who<br/>

  introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who<br/>

  ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the<br/>

  Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the<br/>

  conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the<br/>

  completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important<br/>

  world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt.<br/>

  Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of<br/>

  Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman<br/>

  Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in<br/>

  1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the<br/>

  British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High<br/>

  Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the<br/>

  time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology<br/>

  of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab<br/>

  world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue<br/>

  to overtax resources and stress society. The government has<br/>

  struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through<br/>

  economic reform and massive investment in communications and<br/>

  physical infrastructure.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86539">El Salvador<br/>

  El Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and<br/>

  from the Central American Federation in 1839. A 12-year civil war,<br/>

  which cost about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when<br/>

  the government and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for<br/>

  military and political reforms.<br/>

<p id="id86540">Equatorial Guinea<br/>

  Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968<br/>

  after 190 years of Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a<br/>

  mainland portion plus five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest<br/>

  on the African continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO<br/>

  has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup.<br/>

  Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996,<br/>

  2002, and 2009 presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004<br/>

  legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president<br/>

  exerts almost total control over the political system and has<br/>

  discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced<br/>

  rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil<br/>

  reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's<br/>

  third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall<br/>

  from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government<br/>

  revenue in recent years, there have been few improvements in the<br/>

  population's living standards.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86541">Eritrea<br/>

  The UN awarded Eritrea to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a<br/>

  federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years<br/>

  later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991<br/>

  with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was<br/>

  overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year<br/>

  border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN<br/>

  auspices in December 2000. Eritrea hosted a UN peacekeeping<br/>

  operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ)<br/>

  on the border with Ethiopia. Eritrea's denial of fuel to the mission<br/>

  caused the UN to withdraw the mission and terminate its mandate 31<br/>

  July 2008. An international commission, organized to resolve the<br/>

  border dispute, posted its findings in 2002. However, both parties<br/>

  have been unable to reach agreement on implementing the decision. On<br/>

  30 November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission remotely<br/>

  demarcated the border by coordinates and dissolved itself, leaving<br/>

  Ethiopia still occupying several tracts of disputed territory,<br/>

  including the town of Badme. Eritrea accepted the EEBC's "virtual<br/>

  demarcation" decision and called on Ethiopia to remove its troops<br/>

  from the TSZ that it states is Eritrean territory. Ethiopia has not<br/>

  accepted the virtual demarcation decision. In 2009 the UN imposed<br/>

  sanctions on Eritrea after accusing it of backing anti-Ethiopian<br/>

  Islamist insurgents in Somalia.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86542">Estonia<br/>

  After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian<br/>

  rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated<br/>

  into the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it<br/>

  regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br/>

  Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to<br/>

  promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. It joined<br/>

  both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86543">Ethiopia<br/>

  Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian<br/>

  monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the<br/>

  exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. In 1974,<br/>

  a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had<br/>

  ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody<br/>

  coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems,<br/>

  the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel<br/>

  forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front<br/>

  (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first<br/>

  multiparty elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea<br/>

  late in the 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In<br/>

  November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission remotely<br/>

  demarcated the border by geographical coordinates, but final<br/>

  demarcation of the boundary on the ground is currently on hold<br/>

  because of Ethiopian objections to an international commission's<br/>

  finding requiring it to surrender territory considered sensitive to<br/>

  Ethiopia.<br/>

<p id="id86544" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">European Union
  Following the two devastating World Wars in the first
  half of the 20th century, a number of European leaders in the late
  1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting
  peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations - France and
  Germany - both economically and politically. In 1950, the French
  Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all
  Europe, the first step of which would be the integration of the coal
  and steel industries of Western Europe. The following year the
  European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six
  members, Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the
  Netherlands, signed the Treaty of Paris.
  The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was
  made to integrate other parts of the countries' economies. In 1957,
  the Treaties of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC)
  and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the six
  member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves
  by forming a common market. In 1967, the institutions of all three
  communities were formally merged into the European Community (EC),
  creating a single Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the
  European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were
  initially selected by national parliaments, but in 1979 the first
  direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five
  years since.
  In 1973, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the
  addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The 1980s saw
  further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain
  and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis
  for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in
  judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic
  and monetary union - including a common currency. This further
  integration created the European Union (EU). In 1995, Austria,
  Finland, and Sweden joined the EU, raising the membership total to
  15.
  A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on 1
  January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all of the EU
  states except the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark. In 2002,
  citizens of the 12 euro-area countries (the European Monetary Union
  or EMU) began using the euro banknotes and coins. Ten new countries
  joined the EU in 2004 - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
  Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia -
  and in 2007 Bulgaria and Romania joined, bringing the current
  membership to 27. In order to ensure that the EU can continue to
  function efficiently with an expanded membership, the Treaty of Nice
  (in force as of 1 February 2003) set forth rules streamlining the
  size and procedures of EU institutions. An effort to establish an EU
  constitution, begun in October 2004, failed to attain unanimous
  ratification. A new effort, undertaken in June 2007, created an
  Intergovernmental Conference to formulate a political agreement -
  initially known as the Reform Treaty but subsequently referred to as
  the Treaty of Lisbon - which would serve as a constitution. Unlike
  the constitution, however, the Treaty of Lisbon sought to amend
  existing treaties rather than replace them. In October 2009, an
  Irish referendum approved the Treaty (overturning a previous
  rejection) and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement
  - the Czech Republic signed on soon after. Treaty implementation
  began on 1 December 2009. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default
  on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU
  and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed.</p>

<p id="id86545">Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)<br/>

  Although first sighted by an<br/>

  English navigator in 1592, the first landing (English) did not occur<br/>

  until almost a century later in 1690, and the first settlement<br/>

  (French) was not established until 1764. The colony was turned over<br/>

  to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject<br/>

  of a territorial dispute, first between Britain and Spain, then<br/>

  between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the<br/>

  islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina<br/>

  invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an<br/>

  expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after fierce<br/>

  fighting forced an Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86546">Faroe Islands<br/>

  The population of the Faroe Islands is largely<br/>

  descended from Viking settlers who arrived in the 9th century. The<br/>

  islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th<br/>

  century. A high degree of self government was granted the Faroese in<br/>

  1948, who have autonomy over most internal affairs while Denmark is<br/>

  responsible for justice, defense, and foreign affairs. The Faroe<br/>

  Islands are not part of the European Union.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86547">Fiji<br/>

  Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a<br/>

  British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military<br/>

  coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as<br/>

  dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers<br/>

  brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The<br/>

  coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian<br/>

  control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss<br/>

  resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians<br/>

  became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more<br/>

  equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a<br/>

  government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May<br/>

  2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil.<br/>

  Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a<br/>

  democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia<br/>

  QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006<br/>

  military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially<br/>

  appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became<br/>

  interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has<br/>

  neutralized his opponents, crippled Fiji's democratic institutions,<br/>

  and refused to hold elections.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86548">Finland<br/>

  Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden<br/>

  from the 12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy<br/>

  of Russia after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917.<br/>

  During World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom<br/>

  and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of<br/>

  territory. In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a<br/>

  remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy to a<br/>

  diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now<br/>

  among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the European Union<br/>

  since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro<br/>

  system at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the<br/>

  key features of Finland's modern welfare state are a high standard<br/>

  of education, equality promotion, and national social security<br/>

  system; currently challenged by an aging population and the<br/>

  fluctuations of an export-driven economy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86549">France<br/>

  Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France<br/>

  suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank<br/>

  as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the<br/>

  most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European<br/>

  nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid<br/>

  presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the<br/>

  instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary<br/>

  administrations. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation<br/>

  with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of<br/>

  Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency,<br/>

  the euro, in January 1999.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86550">French Polynesia<br/>

  The French annexed various Polynesian island groups<br/>

  during the 19th century. In September 1995, France stirred up<br/>

  widespread protests by resuming nuclear testing on the Mururoa atoll<br/>

  after a three-year moratorium. The tests were suspended in January<br/>

  1996. In recent years, French Polynesia's autonomy has been<br/>

  considerably expanded.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86551" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">French Southern and Antarctic Lands
  In February 2007, the Iles
  Eparses became an integral part of the French Southern and Antarctic
  Lands (TAAF). The Southern Lands are now divided into five
  administrative districts, two of which are archipelagos, Iles Crozet
  and Iles Kerguelen; the third is a district composed of two volcanic
  islands, Ile Saint-Paul and Ile Amsterdam; the fourth, Iles Eparses,
  consists of five scattered tropical islands around Madagascar. They
  contain no permanent inhabitants and are visited only by researchers
  studying the native fauna, scientists at the various scientific
  stations, fishermen, and military personnel. The fifth district is
  the Antarctic portion, which consists of "Adelie Land," a thin slice
  of the Antarctic continent discovered and claimed by the French in
  1840.
  Ile Amsterdam: Discovered but not named in 1522 by the Spanish, the
  island subsequently received the appellation of Nieuw Amsterdam from
  a Dutchman; it was claimed by France in 1843. A short-lived attempt
  at cattle farming began in 1871. A French meteorological station
  established on the island in 1949 is still in use.
  Ile Saint Paul: Claimed by France since 1893, the island was a
  fishing industry center from 1843 to 1914. In 1928, a spiny lobster
  cannery was established, but when the company went bankrupt in 1931,
  seven workers were abandoned. Only two survived until 1934 when
  rescue finally arrived.
  Iles Crozet: A large archipelago formed from the Crozet Plateau,
  Iles Crozet is divided into two main groups: L'Occidental (the
  West), which includes Ile aux Cochons, Ilots des Apotres, Ile des
  Pingouins, and the reefs Brisants de l'Heroine; and L'Oriental (the
  east), which includes Ile d'Est and Ile de la Possession (the
  largest island of the Crozets). Discovered and claimed by France in
  1772, the islands were used for seal hunting and as a base for
  whaling. Originally administered as a dependency of Madagascar, they
  became part of the TAAF in 1955.
  Iles Kerguelen: This island group, discovered in 1772, is made up of
  one large island (Ile Kerguelen) and about 300 smaller islands. A
  permanent group of 50 to 100 scientists resides at the main base at
  Port-aux-Francais.
  Adelie Land: The only non-insular district of the TAAF is the
  Antarctic claim known as "Adelie Land." The US Government does not
  recognize it as a French dependency.
  Bassas da India: A French possession since 1897, this atoll is a
  volcanic rock surrounded by reefs and is awash at high tide.
  Europa Island: This heavily wooded island has been a French
  possession since 1897; it is the site of a small military garrison
  that staffs a weather station.
  Glorioso Islands: A French possession since 1892, the Glorioso
  Islands are composed of two lushly vegetated coral islands (Ile
  Glorieuse and Ile du Lys) and three rock islets. A military garrison
  operates a weather and radio station on Ile Glorieuse.
  Juan de Nova Island: Named after a famous 15th century Spanish
  navigator and explorer, the island has been a French possession
  since 1897. It has been exploited for its guano and phosphate.
  Presently a small military garrison oversees a meteorological
  station.
  Tromelin Island: First explored by the French in 1776, the island
  came under the jurisdiction of Reunion in 1814. At present, it
  serves as a sea turtle sanctuary and is the site of an important
  meteorological station.</p>

<p id="id86552">Gabon<br/>

  Until recently, only two autocratic presidents had ruled Gabon<br/>

  since its independence from France in 1960. The recent president of<br/>

  Gabon, El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads<br/>

  of state in the world - had dominated the country's political scene<br/>

  for four decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty<br/>

  system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However,<br/>

  allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and<br/>

  the presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal<br/>

  political structures in Gabon. President BONGO died in June 2009.<br/>

  New elections in August 2009 brought Ali Ben BONGO, son of the<br/>

  former president, to power. Despite political conditions, a small<br/>

  population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign<br/>

  support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous and stable<br/>

  African countries. In January 2010, Gabon assumed a nonpermanent<br/>

  seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.<br/>
