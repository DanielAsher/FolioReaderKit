  The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965.<br/>

  Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived<br/>

  federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two<br/>

  nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions<br/>

  have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya A. J. J. JAMMEH led<br/>

  a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned<br/>

  political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in<br/>

  1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a<br/>

  nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president<br/>

  in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2006.<br/>

<p id="id86554">Gaza Strip<br/>

  The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles<br/>

  on Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional<br/>

  period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br/>

  Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September<br/>

  1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security<br/>

  and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of<br/>

  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the<br/>

  permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following<br/>

  the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the<br/>

  Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final<br/>

  settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the<br/>

  two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic<br/>

  Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late<br/>

  2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month<br/>

  later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments<br/>

  in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005,<br/>

  Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and<br/>

  dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew<br/>

  settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank<br/>

  settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace,<br/>

  and most access to the Gaza Strip; and it enforces a restricted zone<br/>

  along the border inside Gaza. In January 2006, the Islamic<br/>

  Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian<br/>

  Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government<br/>

  in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating<br/>

  with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the<br/>

  international community so as to lift economic sanctions on<br/>

  Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in<br/>

  the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous<br/>

  Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS<br/>

  Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi<br/>

  Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National<br/>

  Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA.<br/>

  However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007,<br/>

  HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and<br/>

  governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG<br/>

  and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government<br/>

  in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the<br/>

  NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered<br/>

  reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge<br/>

  their differences. Late November 2007 through June 2008 witnessed a<br/>

  substantial increase in Israeli-Palestinian violence. An<br/>

  Egyptian-brokered truce in June 2008 between Israel and HAMAS<br/>

  brought about a five-month pause in hostilities, but spiraling<br/>

  end-of-year violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1,100 to<br/>

  1,400 Palestinians and left tens of thousands of people homeless.<br/>

  International donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid to rebuild the Gaza<br/>

  Strip, but by the end of 2010 large-scale reconstruction had not<br/>

  begun.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86555">Georgia<br/>

  The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient<br/>

  kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman<br/>

  influence in the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the<br/>

  state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks<br/>

  was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was<br/>

  cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman<br/>

  and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia<br/>

  was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century.<br/>

  Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian<br/>

  revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the<br/>

  Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. An attempt by the incumbent Georgian<br/>

  government to manipulate national legislative elections in November<br/>

  2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of<br/>

  Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early<br/>

  2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National<br/>

  Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has<br/>

  been made in the years since independence, but this progress has<br/>

  been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway<br/>

  regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a series of Russian and<br/>

  separatist provocations in summer 2008, Georgian military action in<br/>

  South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response<br/>

  that not only occupied the breakaway areas, but large portions of<br/>

  Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from most<br/>

  occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia<br/>

  unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South<br/>

  Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's<br/>

  nations and international organizations.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86556">Germany<br/>

  As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation<br/>

  (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic,<br/>

  political, and defense organizations. European power struggles<br/>

  immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of<br/>

  the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious<br/>

  Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945.<br/>

  With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in<br/>

  1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern<br/>

  German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself<br/>

  in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which<br/>

  became the EU, and NATO, while the Communist GDR was on the front<br/>

  line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the<br/>

  end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since<br/>

  then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern<br/>

  productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999,<br/>

  Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European<br/>

  exchange currency, the euro. In January 2011, Germany assumed a<br/>

  nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86557">Ghana<br/>

  Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast<br/>

  and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first<br/>

  sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence.<br/>

  Ghana endured a long series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took<br/>

  power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new<br/>

  constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won<br/>

  presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally<br/>

  prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR<br/>

  succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS took over<br/>

  as head of state in early 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86558">Gibraltar<br/>

  Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded<br/>

  to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British<br/>

  garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum<br/>

  held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British<br/>

  dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK<br/>

  led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication<br/>

  links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997<br/>

  and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar.<br/>

  In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a<br/>

  referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted<br/>

  overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since<br/>

  late 2004, tripartite talks among Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have<br/>

  been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that<br/>

  affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation<br/>

  agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services;<br/>

  communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs<br/>

  services; environmental protection; and education and visa services.<br/>

  Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial<br/>

  waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent<br/>

  maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols. A new<br/>

  noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European<br/>

  Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its<br/>

  own tax regime in December 2008, but the UK retains responsibility<br/>

  for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial<br/>

  stability.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86559">Greece<br/>

  Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829.<br/>

  During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the<br/>

  20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and<br/>

  territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II,<br/>

  Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied<br/>

  by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war<br/>

  between supporters of the king and other anti-Communists and<br/>

  Communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece<br/>

  joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized<br/>

  power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many<br/>

  political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In<br/>

  1974, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary<br/>

  republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC<br/>

  (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and<br/>

  Monetary Union in 2001. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default on<br/>

  its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU and<br/>

  raised the question of whether a member country might voluntarily<br/>

  leave the common currency or be removed.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86560">Greenland<br/>

  Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice<br/>

  capped. Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland;<br/>

  Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was<br/>

  made an integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European<br/>

  Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985<br/>

  over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was<br/>

  granted self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law<br/>

  went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of<br/>

  increased self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater<br/>

  responsibility for internal affairs in June 2009. Denmark, however,<br/>

  continues to exercise control of Greenland's foreign affairs,<br/>

  security, and financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Home<br/>

  Rule Government.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86561">Grenada<br/>

  Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the<br/>

  island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century.<br/>

  The French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar<br/>

  estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took<br/>

  the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the<br/>

  19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export<br/>

  crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In<br/>

  1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full<br/>

  independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest<br/>

  independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized<br/>

  by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the<br/>

  island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean<br/>

  nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds<br/>

  of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following<br/>

  year and have continued since that time. Hurricane Ivan struck<br/>

  Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86562">Guam<br/>

  Guam was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Captured by the<br/>

  Japanese in 1941, it was retaken by the US three years later. The<br/>

  military installation on the island is one of the most strategically<br/>

  important US bases in the Pacific.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86563">Guatemala<br/>

  The Mayan civilization flourished in Guatemala and<br/>

  surrounding regions during the first millennium A.D. After almost<br/>

  three centuries as a Spanish colony, Guatemala won its independence<br/>

  in 1821. During the second half of the 20th century, it experienced<br/>

  a variety of military and civilian governments, as well as a 36-year<br/>

  guerrilla war. In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement<br/>

  formally ending the conflict, which had left more than 100,000<br/>

  people dead and had created, by some estimates, some 1 million<br/>

  refugees.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86564">Guernsey<br/>

  Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last<br/>

  remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy, which held sway in<br/>

  both France and England. The islands were the only British soil<br/>

  occupied by German troops in World War II. Guernsey is a British<br/>

  crown dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.<br/>

  However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its<br/>

  defense and international representation.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86565">Guinea<br/>

  Guinea has had a history of authoritarian rule since gaining<br/>

  its independence from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in<br/>

  1984 when the military seized the government after the death of the<br/>

  first president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic<br/>

  elections until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military<br/>

  government) was elected president of the civilian government. He was<br/>

  reelected in 1998 and again in 2003, though all the polls were<br/>

  marred by irregularities. History repeated itself in December 2008<br/>

  when following President CONTE's death, Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA<br/>

  led a military coup, seizing power and suspending the constitution.<br/>

  His unwillingness to yield to domestic and international pressure to<br/>

  step down led to heightened political tensions that culminated in<br/>

  September 2009 when presidential guards opened fire on an opposition<br/>

  rally killing more than 150 people, and in early December 2009 when<br/>

  CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and evacuated to<br/>

  Morocco and subsequently to Burkina Faso. A transitional government<br/>

  led by General Sekouba KONATE held democratic elections in 2010 and<br/>

  Alpha CONDE was elected president in the country's first free and<br/>

  fair elections since independence.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86566">Guinea-Bissau<br/>

  Since independence from Portugal in 1974,<br/>

  Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military<br/>

  upheaval. In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian<br/>

  dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a<br/>

  path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was<br/>

  characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the<br/>

  purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s<br/>

  and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected<br/>

  president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny<br/>

  and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in<br/>

  May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over<br/>

  power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president<br/>

  in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in<br/>

  office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and<br/>

  businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In<br/>

  2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to<br/>

  pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was<br/>

  assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an<br/>

  emergency election held in June 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86567">Guyana<br/>

  Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana<br/>

  had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to<br/>

  black settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured<br/>

  servants from India to work the sugar plantations. This<br/>

  ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent<br/>

  politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and<br/>

  since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented<br/>

  governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is<br/>

  considered the country's first free and fair election since<br/>

  independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet<br/>

  JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her<br/>

  successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001 and again in 2006.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86568">Haiti<br/>

  The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of<br/>

  Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were<br/>

  virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the<br/>

  early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola.<br/>

  In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island,<br/>

  which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and<br/>

  sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the<br/>

  Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves<br/>

  and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th<br/>

  century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint<br/>

  L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first<br/>

  black republic to declare independence in 1804. The poorest country<br/>

  in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political<br/>

  violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to<br/>

  the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE<br/>

  in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new<br/>

  elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization<br/>

  Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays<br/>

  prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a<br/>

  democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. A<br/>

  massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with<br/>

  an epicenter about 15 km southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince.<br/>

  An estimated 2 million people live within the zone of heavy to<br/>

  moderate structural damage. The earthquake is assessed as the worst<br/>

  in this region over the last 200 years and massive international<br/>

  assistance will be required to help the country recover.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86569">Heard Island and McDonald Islands<br/>

  These uninhabited, barren,<br/>

  sub-Antarctic islands were transferred from the UK to Australia in<br/>

  1947. Populated by large numbers of seal and bird species, the<br/>

  islands have been designated a nature preserve.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86570">Holy See (Vatican City)<br/>

  Popes in their secular role ruled portions<br/>

  of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the<br/>

  mid 19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the<br/>

  newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were<br/>

  further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between<br/>

  a series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by<br/>

  three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of<br/>

  Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy.<br/>

  In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain<br/>

  of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman<br/>

  Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the<br/>

  Holy See include religious freedom, international development, the<br/>

  environment, the Middle East, China, the decline of religion in<br/>

  Europe, terrorism, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and<br/>

  the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and<br/>

  globalization. About one billion people worldwide profess the<br/>

  Catholic faith.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86571">Honduras<br/>

  Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras<br/>

  became an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades<br/>

  of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came<br/>

  to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for<br/>

  anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government<br/>

  and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist<br/>

  guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998,<br/>

  which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion<br/>

  in damage. Since then, the economy has slowly rebounded.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86572">Hong Kong<br/>

  Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded<br/>

  by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later<br/>

  in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and<br/>

  the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special<br/>

  Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on 1<br/>

  July 1997. In this agreement, China promised that, under its "one<br/>

  country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic system<br/>

  would not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a<br/>

  high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense<br/>

  affairs for the next 50 years.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86573">Hungary<br/>

  Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many<br/>

  centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in<br/>

  Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot<br/>

  Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The<br/>

  country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a<br/>

  revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met<br/>

  with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership<br/>

  of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy,<br/>

  introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first<br/>

  multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It<br/>

  joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86574">Iceland<br/>

  Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish)<br/>

  immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland<br/>

  boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the<br/>

  Althing, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland<br/>

  was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja<br/>

  volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused<br/>

  widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the<br/>

  island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited<br/>

  home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence<br/>

  attained in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw<br/>

  substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing<br/>

  industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined<br/>

  the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard<br/>

  hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008.<br/>

  Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world<br/>

  standards.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86575">India<br/>

  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest,<br/>

  flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into<br/>

  northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto<br/>

  the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the<br/>

  earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture.<br/>

  The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached<br/>

  its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age<br/>

  ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a<br/>

  flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across<br/>

  the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th<br/>

  centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi<br/>

  Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established<br/>

  the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries.<br/>

  European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the<br/>

  16th century. By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the<br/>

  dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian<br/>

  Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance<br/>

  to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU,<br/>

  eventually brought about independence in 1947. Communal violence led<br/>

  to the subcontinent's bloody partition, which resulted in the<br/>

  creation of two separate states, India and Pakistan. The two<br/>

  countries have fought three wars since independence, the last of<br/>

  which in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation<br/>

  of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 caused Pakistan<br/>

  to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008,<br/>

  terrorists allegedly originating from Pakistan conducted a series of<br/>

  coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Despite<br/>

  pressing problems such as significant overpopulation, environmental<br/>

  degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, rapid<br/>

  economic development is fueling India's rise on the world stage. In<br/>

  January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the UN Security<br/>

  Council for the 2011-12 term.<br/>

<p id="id86576">Indian Ocean<br/>

  The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's<br/>

  five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger<br/>

  than the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean). Four critically important<br/>

  access waterways are the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab el Mandeb<br/>

  (Djibouti-Yemen), Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman), and Strait of<br/>

  Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia). The decision by the International<br/>

  Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth<br/>

  ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Indian Ocean<br/>

  south of 60 degrees south latitude.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86577">Indonesia<br/>

  The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th<br/>

  century; Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia<br/>

  declared its independence after Japan's surrender, but it required<br/>

  four years of intermittent negotiations, recurring hostilities, and<br/>

  UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty<br/>

  in 1949. Free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999<br/>

  after decades of repressive rule. Indonesia is now the world's third<br/>

  most populous democracy, the world's largest archipelagic state, and<br/>

  home to the world's largest Muslim population. Current issues<br/>

  include: alleviating poverty, improving education, preventing<br/>

  terrorism, consolidating democracy after four decades of<br/>

  authoritarianism, implementing economic and financial reforms,<br/>

  stemming corruption, holding the military and police accountable for<br/>

  human rights violations, addressing climate change, and controlling<br/>

  avian influenza. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace<br/>

  agreement with armed separatists in Aceh, which led to democratic<br/>

  elections in Aceh in December 2006. Indonesia continues to face low<br/>

  intensity armed resistance by the separatist Free Papua Movement.<br/>

<p id="id86578" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Iran
  Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in
  1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza
  PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces
  established a theocratic system of government with ultimate
  political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred
  to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the
  constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a
  popularly elected 86-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations
  have been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US
  Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January
  1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq
  that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
  between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987 and 1988.
  Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its
  activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject
  to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of
  its continued involvement in terrorism and its nuclear weapons
  ambitions. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam
  Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles
  (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in
  response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement
  floundered as conservative politicians, through the control of
  unelected institutions, prevented reform measures from being enacted
  and increased repressive measures. Starting with nationwide
  municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections
  in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected
  government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005
  inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His
  controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests
  over allegations of electoral fraud. The UN Security Council has
  passed a number of resolutions (1696 in July 2006, 1737 in December
  2006, 1747 in March 2007, 1803 in March 2008, and 1835 in September
  2008) calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and
  reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and
  responsibilities. Resolutions 1737, 1477, and 1803 subject a number
  of Iranian individuals and entities involved in Iran's nuclear and
  ballistic missile programs to sanctions. Additionally, several
  Iranian entities are subject to US sanctions under Executive Order
  13382 designations for proliferation activities and EO 13224
  designations for support of terrorism.</p>

<p id="id86579">Iraq<br/>

  Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by<br/>

  Britain during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a<br/>

  League of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over<br/>

  the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in<br/>

  1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series<br/>

  of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM<br/>

  Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and<br/>

  costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait<br/>

  but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War<br/>

  of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN<br/>

  Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass<br/>

  destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification<br/>

  inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions<br/>

  over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in<br/>

  March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces<br/>

  remained in Iraq under a UNSC mandate through 2009 and under a<br/>

  bilateral security agreement thereafter, helping to provide security<br/>

  and to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. In October 2005,<br/>

  Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and,<br/>

  pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member Council of<br/>

  Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. After the election, Ibrahim<br/>

  al-JAFARI was selected as prime minister; he was replaced by Nuri<br/>

  al-MALIKI in May 2006. The CoR approved most cabinet ministers in<br/>

  May 2006, marking the transition to Iraq's first constitutional<br/>

  government in nearly a half century. On 31 January 2009, Iraq held<br/>

  elections for provincial councils in all provinces except for the<br/>

  three provinces comprising the Kurdistan Regional Government and<br/>

  Kirkuk province. Iraq held a national legislative election in March<br/>

  2010, and after nine months of deadlock the CoR approved the new<br/>

  government in December.<br/>

<p id="id86580">Ireland<br/>

  Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C.<br/>

  Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were<br/>

  finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014.<br/>

  English invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than<br/>

  seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions<br/>

  and harsh repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched<br/>

  off several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in<br/>

  independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern<br/>

  (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1949, Ireland withdrew<br/>

  from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in<br/>

  1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of<br/>

  Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A<br/>

  peace settlement for Northern Ireland is gradually being implemented<br/>

  despite some difficulties. In 2006, the Irish and British<br/>

  governments developed and began to implement the St. Andrews<br/>

  Agreement, building on the Good Friday Agreement approved in 1998.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86581">Isle of Man<br/>

  Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the<br/>

  13th century when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the<br/>

  British crown in 1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost<br/>

  extinct Manx Gaelic language. Isle of Man is a British crown<br/>

  dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.<br/>

  However, the UK Government remains constitutionally responsible for<br/>

  its defense and international representation.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86582">Israel<br/>

  Following World War II, the British withdrew from their<br/>

  mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and<br/>

  Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently,<br/>

  the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending<br/>

  the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel<br/>

  occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country<br/>

  profile, unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew<br/>

  from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In<br/>

  keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in<br/>

  October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel<br/>

  and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent<br/>

  settlement. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September<br/>

  1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the "Oslo Accords")<br/>

  guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding<br/>

  territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26<br/>

  October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May<br/>

  2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it<br/>

  had occupied since 1982. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working<br/>

  in conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the "Quartet" - took<br/>

  the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the<br/>

  conflict by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties<br/>

  leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However,<br/>

  progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by<br/>

  Israeli-Palestinian violence between September 2003 and February<br/>

  2005. In the summer of 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from the<br/>

  Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and its military while retaining<br/>

  control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election<br/>

  of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations<br/>

  between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Ehud OLMERT<br/>

  became prime minister in March 2006 and presided over a 34-day<br/>

  conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006 and a 23-day<br/>

  conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip during December 2008 and<br/>

  January 2009. OLMERT, who in June 2007 resumed talks with PA<br/>

  President Mahmoud ABBAS, resigned in September 2008. Prime Minister<br/>

  Binyamin NETANYAHU formed a coalition in March 2009 following a<br/>

  February 2009 general election. Direct talks launched in September<br/>

  2010 collapsed following the expiration of Israel's 10-month partial<br/>

  settlement construction moratorium in the West Bank. Diplomatic<br/>

  initiatives to revive the negotiations through proximity talks began<br/>

  at the end of 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86583">Italy<br/>

  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states<br/>

  of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under<br/>

  King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to<br/>

  a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a<br/>

  Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's<br/>

  defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy<br/>

  in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of<br/>

  NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the<br/>

  forefront of European economic and political unification, joining<br/>

  the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include<br/>

  illegal immigration, organized crime, corruption, high unemployment,<br/>

  sluggish economic growth, and the low incomes and technical<br/>

  standards of southern Italy compared with the prosperous north.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86584">Jamaica<br/>

  The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 -<br/>

  was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native<br/>

  Taino Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were<br/>

  gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England<br/>

  seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based<br/>

  on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed<br/>

  a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica<br/>

  gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain. In 1958 it<br/>

  joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of<br/>

  the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew<br/>

  from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions<br/>

  during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated<br/>

  with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized<br/>

  crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money<br/>

  laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose<br/>

  significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many<br/>

  rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute<br/>

  substantially to the economy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86585">Jan Mayen<br/>

  This desolate, arctic, mountainous island was named after<br/>

  a Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614<br/>

  (earlier claims are inconclusive). Visited only occasionally by seal<br/>

  hunters and trappers over the following centuries, the island came<br/>

  under Norwegian sovereignty in 1929. The long dormant Beerenberg<br/>

  volcano resumed activity in 1970; the most recent eruption occurred<br/>

  in 1985. It is the northernmost active volcano on earth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86586">Japan<br/>

  In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa<br/>

  shogunate (a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long<br/>

  period of relative political stability and isolation from foreign<br/>

  influence. For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to<br/>

  enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports<br/>

  after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began<br/>

  to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and<br/>

  early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to<br/>

  defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea,<br/>

  Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan<br/>

  occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of<br/>

  China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry<br/>

  into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast<br/>

  Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an<br/>

  economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his<br/>

  throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold<br/>

  actual decision-making power. Following three decades of<br/>

  unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown<br/>

  starting in the 1990s, but the country remains a major economic<br/>

  power.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86587">Jersey<br/>

  Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last<br/>

  remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy that held sway in both<br/>

  France and England. These islands were the only British soil<br/>

  occupied by German troops in World War II. Jersey is a British crown<br/>

  dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.<br/>

  However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its<br/>

  defense and international representation.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86588">Jordan<br/>

  Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman<br/>

  Empire, the UK received a mandate to govern much of the Middle East.<br/>

  Britain separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from<br/>

  Palestine in the early 1920s, and the area gained its independence<br/>

  in 1946; it adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's<br/>

  long-time ruler was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader, he<br/>

  successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers<br/>

  (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large<br/>

  internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel<br/>

  in the 1967 war and barely managed to defeat Palestinian rebels who<br/>

  attempted to overthrow the monarchy in 1970. King HUSSEIN in 1988<br/>

  permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank. In 1989,<br/>

  he reinstituted parliamentary elections and initiated a gradual<br/>

  political liberalization; political parties were legalized in 1992.<br/>

  In 1994, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, the<br/>

  son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following his father's death<br/>

  in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and<br/>

  undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to<br/>

  the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to participate in<br/>

  the European Free Trade Association in 2001. In 2003, Jordan<br/>

  staunchly supported the Coalition ouster of Saddam in Iraq and<br/>

  following the outbreak of insurgent violence in Iraq, absorbed<br/>

  thousands of displaced Iraqis. Municipal elections were held in July<br/>

  2007 under a system in which 20% of seats in all municipal councils<br/>

  were reserved by quota for women. Parliamentary elections were held<br/>

  in November 2010 and saw independent pro-government candidates win<br/>

  the vast majority of seats.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86589">Kazakhstan<br/>

  Ethnic Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes<br/>

  who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united<br/>

  as a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th<br/>

  century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the<br/>

  1950s and 1960s agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens<br/>

  were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures.<br/>

  This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other<br/>

  deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled<br/>

  non-ethnic Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 drove<br/>

  many of these newcomers to emigrate. Kazakhstan's economy is larger<br/>

  than those of all the other Central Asian states largely due to the<br/>

  country's vast natural resources. Current issues include: developing<br/>

  a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the<br/>

  country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;<br/>

  diversifying the economy outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors;<br/>

  enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness; developing a<br/>

  multiparty parliament and advancing political and social reform; and<br/>

  strengthening relations with neighboring states and other foreign<br/>

  powers.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86590">Kenya<br/>

  Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA<br/>

  led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when<br/>

  President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional<br/>

  succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969<br/>

  until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made<br/>

  itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and<br/>

  external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The<br/>

  ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power<br/>

  in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and<br/>

  fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the<br/>

  Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following<br/>

  fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate<br/>

  of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow<br/>

  Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed<br/>

  the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption<br/>

  platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over the<br/>

  constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU<br/>

  to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement,<br/>

  which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular<br/>

  referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007<br/>

  brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and<br/>

  unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people<br/>

  died. UN-sponsored talks in late February produced a powersharing<br/>

  accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position<br/>

  of prime minister.<br/>

<p id="id86591">Kiribati<br/>

  The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892<br/>

  and a colony in 1915; they were captured by the Japanese in the<br/>

  Pacific War in 1941. The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites<br/>

  of major US amphibious victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons<br/>

  in 1943. The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in<br/>

  1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of<br/>

  Kiribati. The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited<br/>

  Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with<br/>

  Kiribati.<br/>

<p id="id86592">Korea, North<br/>

  An independent kingdom for much of its long history,<br/>

  Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the<br/>

  Russo-Japanese War. Five years later, Japan formally annexed the<br/>

  entire peninsula. Following World War II, Korea was split with the<br/>

  northern half coming under Soviet-sponsored Communist control. After<br/>

  failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed<br/>

  Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force, North<br/>

  Korea (DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a<br/>

  policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic "self-reliance" as a<br/>

  check against outside influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the<br/>

  ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded<br/>

  propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies<br/>

  around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of<br/>

  Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM's son, the current ruler KIM<br/>

  Jong Il, was officially designated as his father's successor in<br/>

  1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the<br/>

  elder KIM's death in 1994. After decades of economic mismanagement<br/>

  and resource misallocation, the DPRK since the mid-1990s has relied<br/>

  heavily on international aid to feed its population. North Korea's<br/>

  history of regional military provocations, proliferation of<br/>

  military-related items, long-range missile development, WMD programs<br/>

  including tests of nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009, and massive<br/>

  conventional armed forces are of major concern to the international<br/>

  community.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86593">Korea, South<br/>

  An independent Korean state or collection of states has<br/>

  existed almost continuously for several millennia. Between its<br/>

  initial unification in the 7th century - from three predecessor<br/>

  Korean states - until the 20th century, Korea existed as a single<br/>

  independent country. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War,<br/>

  Korea became a protectorate of imperial Japan, and in 1910 it was<br/>

  annexed as a colony. Korea regained its independence following<br/>

  Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II,<br/>

  a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the<br/>

  Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in<br/>

  the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and<br/>

  UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South<br/>

  Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An<br/>

  armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a<br/>

  demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South<br/>

  Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising<br/>

  to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Young-sam<br/>

  became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of<br/>

  military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern<br/>

  democracy. President LEE Myung-bak has pursued a policy of global<br/>

  engagement since taking office in February 2008, highlighted by<br/>

  Seoul's hosting of the G-20 summit in November 2010. Serious<br/>

  tensions with North Korea have punctuated inter-Korean relations in<br/>

  recent years, including the North's sinking of the South Korean<br/>

  warship Cheonan in March 2010 and its artillery attack on South<br/>

  Korean soldiers and citizens in November 2010.<br/>

<p id="id86594">Kosovo<br/>

  Ethnic Serbs migrated to the territories of modern Kosovo in<br/>

  the 7th century but did not fully incorporate them into the Serbian<br/>

  realm until the early 13th century. During the medieval period,<br/>

  Kosovo became the center of a Serbian Empire and saw the<br/>

  construction of many important Serb religious sites, including many<br/>

  architecturally significant Serbian Orthodox monasteries. The defeat<br/>

  of Serbian forces at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five<br/>

  centuries of Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and<br/>

  Albanians moved to Kosovo. By the end of the 19th century, Albanians<br/>

  replaced the Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia<br/>

  reacquired control over Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire during the<br/>

  First Balkan War of 1912. Kosovo became an autonomous province of<br/>

  Serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the<br/>

  1974 Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.<br/>

  Despite legislative concessions, Albanian nationalism increased in<br/>

  the 1980s, which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's independence.<br/>

  At the same time, Serb nationalist leaders, such as Slobodan<br/>

  MILOSEVIC, exploited Kosovo Serb claims of maltreatment to secure<br/>

  votes from supporters, many of whom viewed Kosovo as their cultural<br/>

  heartland. Under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia instituted a new<br/>

  constitution in 1989 that revoked Kosovo's status as an autonomous<br/>

  province of Serbia. Kosovo Albanian leaders responded in 1991 by<br/>

  organizing a referendum that declared Kosovo independent. Under<br/>

  MILOSEVIC, Serbia carried out repressive measures against the<br/>

  Albanians in the early 1990s as the unofficial Kosovo government,<br/>

  led by Ibrahim RUGOVA, used passive resistance in an attempt to try<br/>

  to gain international assistance and recognition of an independent<br/>

  Kosovo. Albanians dissatisfied with RUGOVA's passive strategy in the<br/>

  1990s created the Kosovo Liberation Army and launched an insurgency.<br/>

  Starting in 1998, Serbian military, police, and paramilitary forces<br/>

  conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres<br/>

  and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians. Approximately 800,000<br/>

  Albanians were forced from their homes in Kosovo during this time.<br/>

  International attempts to mediate the conflict failed, and<br/>

  MILOSEVIC's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month<br/>

  NATO military campaign against Serbia beginning in March 1999 that<br/>

  forced Serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces<br/>

  from Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed<br/>

  Kosovo under a transitional administration, the UN Interim<br/>

  Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), pending a determination of<br/>

  Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process began in late 2005 to<br/>

  determine Kosovo's final status. The negotiations ran in stages<br/>

  between 2006 and 2007, but ended without agreement between Belgrade<br/>

  and Pristina. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared<br/>

  Kosovo independent. Since then, over sixty countries have recognized<br/>

  Kosovo, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund and World<br/>

  Bank. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence and it<br/>

  subsequently sought an advisory opinion from the International Court<br/>

  of Justice (ICJ) on the legality under international law of Kosovo's<br/>

  independence declaration. In July 2010 the ICJ ruled that Kosovo's<br/>

  declaration of independence did not violate international law.<br/>

<p id="id86595">Kuwait<br/>

  Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling<br/>

  Kuwaiti AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961.<br/>

  Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following<br/>

  several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a<br/>

  ground assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four<br/>

  days. Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure<br/>

  damaged during 1990-91. The AL-SABAH family has ruled since<br/>

  returning to power in 1991 and reestablished an elected legislature<br/>

  that in recent years has become increasingly assertive. The country<br/>

  witnessed the historic election in May 2009 of four women to its<br/>

  National Assembly.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86596">Kyrgyzstan<br/>

  A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and<br/>

  proud nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to<br/>

  Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist<br/>

  Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population<br/>

  was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved<br/>

  independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide<br/>

  demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of<br/>

  President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990.<br/>

  Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won<br/>

  overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Over the<br/>

  next few years, the new president manipulated the parliament to<br/>

  accrue new powers for himself. In July 2009, after months of<br/>

  harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won<br/>

  re-election in a presidential campaign that the international<br/>

  community deemed flawed. In April 2010, nationwide protests led to<br/>

  the resignation and expulsion of BAKIEV. He was replaced by<br/>

  President Roza OTUNBAEVA who will serve as president until 31<br/>

  December 2011 according to a presidential decree issued 19 May 2010.<br/>

  Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in October 2011.<br/>

  Continuing concerns include: endemic corruption, poor interethnic<br/>

  relations, and terrorism.<br/>

<p id="id86597">Laos<br/>

  Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan<br/>

  Xang, established in the 14th Century under King FA NGUM. For 300<br/>

  years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and<br/>

  Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries<br/>

  of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam<br/>

  (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century<br/>

  when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty<br/>

  of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the<br/>

  Communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a<br/>

  six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime<br/>

  closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private<br/>

  enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began<br/>

  in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997. In late 2009,<br/>

  Thailand returned to Laos about 3,000 Hmong residing in refugee<br/>

  camps.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86598">Latvia<br/>

  The name "Latvia" originates from the ancient Latgalians, one<br/>

  of four eastern Baltic tribes that formed the ethnic core of the<br/>

  Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries A.D.). The region<br/>

  subsequently came under the control of Germans, Poles, Swedes, and<br/>

  finally, Russians. A Latvian republic emerged following World War I,<br/>

  but it was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized<br/>

  by the US and many other countries. Latvia reestablished its<br/>

  independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union.<br/>

  Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the<br/>

  Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to<br/>

  Moscow. Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.<br/>

<p id="id86599" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Lebanon
  Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the
  northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The
  French separated out the region of Lebanon in 1920, and granted this
  area independence in 1943. A lengthy civil war (1975-1990)
  devastated the country, but Lebanon has since made progress toward
  rebuilding its political institutions. Under the Ta'if Accord - the
  blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese established a
  more equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a
  greater voice in the political process while institutionalizing
  sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war,
  Lebanon has conducted several successful elections. Most militias
  have been reduced or disbanded, with the exception of Hizballah,
  designated by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist
  Organization, and Palestinian militant groups. During Lebanon's
  civil war, the Arab League legitimized in the Ta'if Accord Syria's
  troop deployment, numbering about 16,000 based mainly east of Beirut
  and in the Bekaa Valley. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon
  in May 2000 and the passage in September 2004 of UNSCR 1559 - a
  resolution calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and end its
  interference in Lebanese affairs - encouraged some Lebanese groups
  to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well. The assassination
  of former Prime Minister Rafiq HARIRI and 22 others in February 2005
  led to massive demonstrations in Beirut against the Syrian presence
  ("the Cedar Revolution"), and Syria withdrew the remainder of its
  military forces in April 2005. In May-June 2005, Lebanon held its
  first legislative elections since the end of the civil war free of
  foreign interference, handing a majority to the bloc led by Sa'ad
  HARIRI, the slain prime minister's son. In July 2006, Hizballah
  kidnapped two Israeli soldiers leading to a 34-day conflict with
  Israel in which approximately 1,200 Lebanese civilians were killed.
  UNSCR 1701 ended the war in August 2006, and Lebanese Armed Forces
  (LAF) deployed throughout the country for the first time in decades,
  charged with securing Lebanon's borders against weapons smuggling
  and maintaining a weapons-free zone in south Lebanon with the help
  of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The LAF in
  May-September 2007 battled Sunni extremist group Fatah al-Islam in
  the Nahr al-Barid Palestinian refugee camp, winning a decisive
  victory, but destroying the camp and displacing 30,000 Palestinian
  residents. Lebanese politicians in November 2007 were unable to
  agree on a successor to Emile LAHUD when he stepped down as
  president, creating a political vacuum until the election of LAF
  Commander Gen. Michel SULAYMAN in May 2008 and the formation of a
  new unity government in July 2008. Legislative elections in June
  2009 again produced victory for the bloc led by Sa'ad HARIRI, but a
  period of prolonged negotiation over the composition of the cabinet
  ensued. A national unity government was finally formed in November
  2009 and approved by the National Assembly the following month. In
  January 2010, Lebanon assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security
  Council for the 2010-11 term.</p>

<p id="id86600">Lesotho<br/>

  Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon<br/>

  independence from the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled<br/>

  for the first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but<br/>

  returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995.<br/>

  Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of<br/>

  military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny<br/>

  following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody<br/>

  intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the<br/>

  aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent<br/>

  constitutional reforms restored relative political stability.<br/>

  Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National<br/>

  Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and<br/>

  aggrieved parties continue to dispute how the electoral law was<br/>

  applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86601">Liberia<br/>

  Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today<br/>

  Liberia began in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to<br/>

  establish a republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did<br/>

  much to promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic,<br/>

  social, and political gaps between the descendents of the original<br/>

  settlers and the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military<br/>

  coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In<br/>

  December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's<br/>

  regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE himself was<br/>

  killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections<br/>

  that brought TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An<br/>

  August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the<br/>

  resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who faces war crimes<br/>

  charges in The Hague related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's<br/>

  civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional government,<br/>

  democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON<br/>

  SIRLEAF to power. The UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) maintains a<br/>

  strong presence throughout the country, but the security situation<br/>

  is still fragile and the process of rebuilding the social and<br/>

  economic structure of this war-torn country continues.<br/>

<p id="id86602" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Libya
  The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around
  Tripoli in 1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when
  defeated in World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and
  achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col.
  Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI began to espouse his own political
  system, the Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of
  socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is
  supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a
  unique form of "direct democracy." QADHAFI has always seen himself
  as a revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during
  the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya,
  supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of
  Marxism and capitalism. In addition, beginning in 1973, he engaged
  in military operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain
  access to minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian
  politics - but was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992
  isolated QADHAFI politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight
  103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. During the 1990s, QADHAFI began to
  rebuild his relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended
  in April 1999 and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya
  accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. In December 2003,
  Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to
  develop weapons of mass destruction and to renounce terrorism.
  QADHAFI has made significant strides in normalizing relations with
  Western nations since then. He has received various Western European
  leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations,
  and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he
  traveled to Brussels in April 2004. The US rescinded Libya's
  designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006. In January
  2008, Libya assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council
  for the 2008-09 term. In August 2008, the US and Libya signed a
  bilateral comprehensive claims settlement agreement to compensate
  claimants in both countries who allege injury or death at the hands
  of the other country, including the Lockerbie bombing, the LaBelle
  disco bombing, and the UTA 772 bombing. In October 2008, the US
  Government received $1.5 billion pursuant to the agreement to
  distribute to US national claimants, and as a result effectively
  normalized its bilateral relationship with Libya. The two countries
  then exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 1973 in January
  2009. Libya in May 2010 was elected to its first three-year seat on
  the UN Human Rights Council, prompting protests from international
  non-governmental organizations and human rights campaigners.</p>

<p id="id86603">Liechtenstein<br/>

  The Principality of Liechtenstein was established<br/>

  within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and<br/>

  Russian troops during the Napoleonic wars, it became a sovereign<br/>

  state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815.<br/>

  Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the<br/>

  Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was<br/>

  closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that<br/>

  conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary<br/>

  union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein<br/>

  remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding<br/>

  economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory<br/>

  oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial<br/>

  institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein<br/>

  implemented anti-money-laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal<br/>

  Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.<br/>
