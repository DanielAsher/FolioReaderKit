  <body><p id="id86604">Lithuania<br/>

  Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over<br/>

  the next century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended<br/>

  its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By<br/>

  the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in<br/>

  Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a<br/>

  union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and<br/>

  Poland formally united into a single dual state, the<br/>

  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when<br/>

  its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries. Lithuania<br/>

  regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by<br/>

  the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many<br/>

  other countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the<br/>

  Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not<br/>

  recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the<br/>

  abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993.<br/>

  Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into<br/>

  Western European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in the<br/>

  spring of 2004.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86605">Luxembourg<br/>

  Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815<br/>

  and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than<br/>

  half of its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure<br/>

  of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by<br/>

  Germany in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it<br/>

  entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the<br/>

  following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding<br/>

  countries of the European Economic Community (later the European<br/>

  Union), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86606">Macau<br/>

  Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the<br/>

  first European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an agreement<br/>

  signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became the<br/>

  Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic<br/>

  of China on 20 December 1999. In this agreement, China promised<br/>

  that, under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's<br/>

  socialist economic system would not be practiced in Macau, and that<br/>

  Macau would enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except<br/>

  foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86607">Macedonia<br/>

  Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from<br/>

  Yugoslavia in 1991. Greece's objection to the new state's use of<br/>

  what it considered a Hellenic name and symbols delayed international<br/>

  recognition, which occurred under the provisional designation of<br/>

  "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." In 1995, Greece lifted<br/>

  a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize<br/>

  relations. The United States began referring to Macedonia by its<br/>

  constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia, in 2004 and negotiations<br/>

  continue between Greece and Macedonia to resolve the name issue.<br/>

  Some ethnic Albanians, angered by perceived political and economic<br/>

  inequities, launched an insurgency in 2001 that eventually won the<br/>

  support of the majority of Macedonia's Albanian population and led<br/>

  to the internationally-brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which<br/>

  ended the fighting by establishing a set of new laws enhancing the<br/>

  rights of minorities. Fully implementing the Framework Agreement and<br/>

  stimulating economic growth and development continue to be<br/>

  challenges for Macedonia, although progress has been made on both<br/>

  fronts over the past several years.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86608">Madagascar<br/>

  Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a<br/>

  French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. During<br/>

  1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held<br/>

  ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second<br/>

  presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and<br/>

  1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential<br/>

  election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and<br/>

  Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country.<br/>

  In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA<br/>

  the winner. RAVALOMANANA achieved a second term following a<br/>

  landslide victory in the generally free and fair presidential<br/>

  elections of 2006. In early 2009, protests over increasing<br/>

  restrictions on opposition press and activities resulted in<br/>

  RAVALOMANANA stepping down and the presidency was conferred to the<br/>

  mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA. Following negotiations in<br/>

  July and August of 2009, a power-sharing agreement with a 15-month<br/>

  transitional period was established, but has not yet been<br/>

  implemented.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86609">Malawi<br/>

  Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland<br/>

  became the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades<br/>

  of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country<br/>

  held multiparty elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution<br/>

  that came into full effect the following year. Current President<br/>

  Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by<br/>

  the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another<br/>

  term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and<br/>

  subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party<br/>

  (DPP) in 2005. As president, MUTHARIKA has overseen economic<br/>

  improvement but because of political deadlock in the legislature,<br/>

  his minority party has been unable to pass significant legislation,<br/>

  and anti-corruption measures have stalled. Population growth,<br/>

  increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the<br/>

  spread of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi. MUTHARIKA was<br/>

  reelected to a second term in May 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86610">Malaysia<br/>

  During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain<br/>

  established colonies and protectorates in the area of current<br/>

  Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948,<br/>

  the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the<br/>

  Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was<br/>

  formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the<br/>

  East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of<br/>

  Borneo joined the Federation. The first several years of the<br/>

  country's history were marred by a Communist insurgency, Indonesian<br/>

  confrontation with Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and<br/>

  Singapore's secession from the Federation in 1965. During the<br/>

  22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR bin Mohamad (1981-2003),<br/>

  Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence<br/>

  on exports of raw materials to expansion in manufacturing, services,<br/>

  and tourism.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86611">Maldives<br/>

  The Maldives was long a sultanate, first under Dutch and<br/>

  then under British protection. It became a republic in 1968, three<br/>

  years after independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated<br/>

  the islands' political scene for 30 years, elected to six successive<br/>

  terms by single-party referendums. Following riots in the capital<br/>

  Male in August 2004, the president and his government pledged to<br/>

  embark upon democratic reforms including a more representative<br/>

  political system and expanded political freedoms. Progress was<br/>

  sluggish, however, and many promised reforms were slow to be<br/>

  realized. Nonetheless, political parties were legalized in 2005. In<br/>

  June 2008, a constituent assembly - termed the "Special Majlis" -<br/>

  finalized a new constitution, which was ratified by the president in<br/>

  August. The first-ever presidential elections under a<br/>

  multi-candidate, multi-party system were held in October 2008.<br/>

  GAYOOM was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED, a political<br/>

  activist who had been jailed several years earlier by the former<br/>

  regime. Challenges facing the new president include strengthening<br/>

  democracy and combating poverty and drug abuse. Maldives officials<br/>

  have been prominent participants in international climate change<br/>

  talks due to the islands' low elevation and the threat from<br/>

  sea-level rise.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86612">Mali<br/>

  The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France<br/>

  in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a<br/>

  few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed<br/>

  Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a<br/>

  military coup - led by the current president Amadou TOURE - enabling<br/>

  Mali's emergence as one of the strongest democracies on the<br/>

  continent. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first democratic<br/>

  presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997. In keeping<br/>

  with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, KONARE stepped down in<br/>

  2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE, who was subsequently elected<br/>

  to a second term in 2007. The elections were widely judged to be<br/>

  free and fair.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86613">Malta<br/>

  Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814.<br/>

  The island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and<br/>

  remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964. A<br/>

  decade later Malta became a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the<br/>

  island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a<br/>

  financial center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU<br/>

  member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86614">Marshall Islands<br/>

  After almost four decades under US administration<br/>

  as the easternmost part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific<br/>

  Islands, the Marshall Islands attained independence in 1986 under a<br/>

  Compact of Free Association. Compensation claims continue as a<br/>

  result of US nuclear testing on some of the atolls between 1947 and<br/>

  1962. The Marshall Islands hosts the US Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA)<br/>

  Reagan Missile Test Site, a key installation in the US missile<br/>

  defense network.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86615">Mauritania<br/>

  Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the<br/>

  southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in<br/>

  1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario<br/>

  guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould<br/>

  Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania<br/>

  with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of<br/>

  presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A<br/>

  bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in<br/>

  a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule.<br/>

  Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in<br/>

  April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected<br/>

  president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military<br/>

  junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and ushered<br/>

  in a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected<br/>

  president in July 2009. The country continues to experience ethnic<br/>

  tensions among its black population (Afro-Mauritanians) and white<br/>

  and black Moor (Arab-Berber) communities, and is having to confront<br/>

  a growing terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb<br/>

  (AQIM).<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86616">Mauritius<br/>

  Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the<br/>

  10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the<br/>

  16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in<br/>

  honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century. The French<br/>

  assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important<br/>

  naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a<br/>

  plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in<br/>

  1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically<br/>

  important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an<br/>

  important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy<br/>

  operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence.<br/>

  Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy<br/>

  with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the<br/>

  country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned<br/>

  one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather,<br/>

  declining sugar prices, and declining textile and apparel<br/>

  production, have slowed economic growth, leading to some protests<br/>

  over standards of living in the Creole community.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86617">Mayotte<br/>

  Mayotte was ceded to France along with the other islands of<br/>

  the Comoros group in 1843. It was the only island in the archipelago<br/>

  that voted in 1974 to retain its link with France and forego<br/>

  independence. In March 2009, Mayotte voted overwhelmingly to become<br/>

  France's 101st department - and fifth overseas department - a change<br/>

  scheduled to become official in 2011.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86618">Mexico<br/>

  The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came<br/>

  under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence<br/>

  early in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994<br/>

  threw Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession<br/>

  in over half a century. The global financial crisis beginning in<br/>

  late 2008 caused another massive economic downturn the following<br/>

  year. As the economy recovers, ongoing economic and social concerns<br/>

  include low real wages, underemployment for a large segment of the<br/>

  population, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement<br/>

  opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the<br/>

  impoverished southern states. The elections held in 2000 marked the<br/>

  first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition<br/>

  candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) -<br/>

  defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary<br/>

  Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate<br/>

  Felipe CALDERON. In January 2009, Mexico assumed a nonpermanent seat<br/>

  on the UN Security Council for the 2009-10 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86619">Micronesia, Federated States of<br/>

  In 1979 the Federated States of<br/>

  Micronesia, a UN Trust Territory under US administration, adopted a<br/>

  constitution. In 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of<br/>

  Free Association with the US, which was amended and renewed in 2004.<br/>

  Present concerns include large-scale unemployment, overfishing, and<br/>

  overdependence on US aid.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86620">Moldova<br/>

  Part of Romania during the interwar period, Moldova was<br/>

  incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II.<br/>

  Although the country has been independent from the USSR since 1991,<br/>

  Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the<br/>

  Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population, mostly<br/>

  Ukrainians and Russians, who have proclaimed a "Transnistria"<br/>

  republic. One of the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the<br/>

  first former Soviet state to elect a Communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as<br/>

  its president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until<br/>

  he resigned in September 2009, following the opposition's gain of a<br/>

  narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist<br/>

  Party's (PCRM) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of<br/>

  parliamentary votes required to elect a president. Moldova's four<br/>

  opposition parties formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European<br/>

  Integration (AEI), which acted as Moldova's governing coalition<br/>

  until parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and a new<br/>

  governing coalition could be formed. Moldova experienced significant<br/>

  political uncertainty in 2009 and 2010, holding three general<br/>

  elections (in April 2009, July 2009, and November 2010) and four<br/>

  presidential ballots in parliament, all of which failed to secure a<br/>

  president.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86621">Monaco<br/>

  The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present day<br/>

  Monaco in 1215. The current ruling Grimaldi family first seized<br/>

  temporary control in 1297, and again in 1331, but were not able to<br/>

  permanently secure their holding until 1419. Economic development<br/>

  was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to<br/>

  France and the opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's<br/>

  mild climate, splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have made<br/>

  Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86622">Mongolia<br/>

  The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under<br/>

  Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through<br/>

  conquest. After his death the empire was divided into several<br/>

  powerful Mongol states, but these broke apart in the 14th century.<br/>

  The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands<br/>

  and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won<br/>

  its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a Communist regime<br/>

  was installed in 1924. The modern country of Mongolia, however,<br/>

  represents only part of the Mongols' historical homeland; more<br/>

  ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in<br/>

  the People's Republic of China than in Mongolia. Following a<br/>

  peaceful democratic revolution, the ex-Communist Mongolian People's<br/>

  Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won elections in 1990 and 1992, but was<br/>

  defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) in the 1996<br/>

  parliamentary election. The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the<br/>

  2000 parliamentary election, but the party lost seats in the 2004<br/>

  election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from<br/>

  2004-08. The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008<br/>

  parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition<br/>

  government with the Democratic Party. In 2010 the MPRP voted to<br/>

  retake the name of the Mongolian People's Party (MPP), a name it<br/>

  used in the early 1920s. The prime minister and most cabinet members<br/>

  are MPP members.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86623">Montenegro<br/>

  The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century<br/>

  when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of<br/>

  Zeta; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its<br/>

  independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th<br/>

  centuries, Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop<br/>

  princes; in 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality.<br/>

  After World War I, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs,<br/>

  Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in<br/>

  1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent<br/>

  republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the<br/>

  latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, first as<br/>

  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, in a looser<br/>

  union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its<br/>

  right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to<br/>

  hold a referendum on independence from the state union. The vote for<br/>

  severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55% - the threshold set by the EU<br/>

  - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June<br/>

  2006.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86624">Montserrat<br/>

  English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled<br/>

  on Montserrat in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three<br/>

  decades later. The British and French fought for possession of the<br/>

  island for most of the 18th century, but it finally was confirmed as<br/>

  a British possession in 1783. The island's sugar plantation economy<br/>

  was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century.<br/>

  Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population<br/>

  fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano<br/>

  that began on 18 July 1995. Montserrat has endured volcanic activity<br/>

  since, with the last eruption occurring in July 2003.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86625">Morocco<br/>

  In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North<br/>

  Africa, successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In<br/>

  the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad<br/>

  AL-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a<br/>

  golden age. The Alaouite dynasty, to which the current Moroccan<br/>

  royal family belongs, established a sultanate in Morocco beginning<br/>

  in the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and<br/>

  ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers<br/>

  that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French<br/>

  imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence<br/>

  struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The<br/>

  internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were<br/>

  turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V,<br/>

  the current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a<br/>

  constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of King.<br/>

  Morocco annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s, but final<br/>

  resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved.<br/>

  Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment<br/>

  of a bicameral legislature, which first met in 1997. Under King<br/>

  MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999 succeeded his father to the throne - human<br/>

  rights have improved. Morocco enjoys a moderately free press, but<br/>

  the government occasionally takes action against journalists who<br/>

  report on three broad subjects considered to be taboo: the monarchy,<br/>

  Islam, and the status of Western Sahara. Despite the continuing<br/>

  reforms, ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86626">Mozambique<br/>

  Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a<br/>

  close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic<br/>

  dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil<br/>

  war hindered the country's development until the mid 1990's. The<br/>

  ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party<br/>

  formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the<br/>

  following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market<br/>

  economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel<br/>

  Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in<br/>

  1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition<br/>

  as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His<br/>

  elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the<br/>

  sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86627">Namibia<br/>

  South Africa occupied the German colony of South-West Africa<br/>

  during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after<br/>

  World War II, when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist<br/>

  South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group<br/>

  launched a war of independence for the area that became Namibia, but<br/>

  it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its<br/>

  administration in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire<br/>

  region. Namibia has been governed by SWAPO since the country won<br/>

  independence in 1990. Hifikepunye POHAMBA was elected president in<br/>

  November 2004 in a landslide victory replacing Sam NUJOMA who led<br/>

  the country during its first 14 years of self rule. POHAMBA was<br/>

  reelected in November 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86628">Nauru<br/>

  The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their<br/>

  language does not resemble any other in the Pacific. The island was<br/>

  annexed by Germany in 1888. Its phosphate deposits began to be mined<br/>

  early in the 20th century by a German-British consortium. Nauru was<br/>

  occupied by Australian forces in World War I and subsequently became<br/>

  a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a<br/>

  brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It<br/>

  achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the<br/>

  world's smallest independent republic.<br/>

<p id="id86629">Navassa Island<br/>

  This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857<br/>

  for its guano. Mining took place between 1865 and 1898. The<br/>

  lighthouse, built in 1917, was shut down in 1996 and administration<br/>

  of Navassa Island transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department<br/>

  of the Interior. A 1998 scientific expedition to the island<br/>

  described it as a unique preserve of Caribbean biodiversity; the<br/>

  following year it became a National Wildlife Refuge and annual<br/>

  scientific expeditions have continued.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86630">Nepal<br/>

  In 1951, the Nepalese monarch ended the century-old system of<br/>

  rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of<br/>

  government. Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy<br/>

  within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led<br/>

  by Maoist extremists broke out in 1996. The ensuing ten-year civil<br/>

  war between insurgents and government forces witnessed the<br/>

  dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute<br/>

  power by the king. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were<br/>

  followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists<br/>

  and government officials, and culminated in a November 2006 peace<br/>

  accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a<br/>

  nation-wide election in April 2008, the newly formed Constituent<br/>

  Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished<br/>

  the monarchy at its first meeting the following month. The<br/>

  Constituent Assembly elected the country's first president in July.<br/>

  The Maoists, who received a plurality of votes in the Constituent<br/>

  Assembly election, formed a coalition government in August 2008, but<br/>

  resigned in May 2009 after the president overruled a decision to<br/>

  fire the chief of the army staff. The Communist Party of<br/>

  Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist and the Nepali Congress party then<br/>

  formed a new coalition government with several smaller parties. In<br/>

  June 2010, the prime minister resigned but, as of December 2010,<br/>

  continued to lead a caretaker government while the parties debate<br/>

  who should lead the next government. Disagreements among the<br/>

  political parties over issues such as the future of former Maoist<br/>

  combatants has hindered the drafting of a new constitution — due in<br/>

  May 2011 — and the formal conclusion of the peace process.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86631">Netherlands<br/>

  The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence<br/>

  from Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading<br/>

  seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around<br/>

  the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the<br/>

  Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a<br/>

  separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I,<br/>

  but suffered invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A<br/>

  modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large<br/>

  exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member<br/>

  of NATO and the EEC (now the EU), and participated in the<br/>

  introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former<br/>

  Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands -<br/>

  Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in<br/>

  the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint<br/>

  Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent<br/>

  countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86632">New Caledonia<br/>

  Settled by both Britain and France during the first<br/>

  half of the 19th century, the island was made a French possession in<br/>

  1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864.<br/>

  Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in<br/>

  the 1998 Noumea Accord, which over a period of 15 to 20 years will<br/>

  transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from<br/>

  France to New Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to<br/>

  conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New<br/>

  Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86633">New Zealand<br/>

  The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D.<br/>

  800. In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain,<br/>

  the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen<br/>

  Victoria while retaining territorial rights. In that same year, the<br/>

  British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of<br/>

  land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native<br/>

  peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent<br/>

  dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both World Wars.<br/>

  New Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances<br/>

  lapsed by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to<br/>

  address longstanding Maori grievances.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86634">Nicaragua<br/>

  The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish<br/>

  colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from<br/>

  Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent<br/>

  republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first<br/>

  half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region<br/>

  in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental<br/>

  manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and<br/>

  resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist<br/>

  Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist<br/>

  rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista<br/>

  contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990,<br/>

  1996, and 2001, saw the Sandinistas defeated, but voting in 2006<br/>

  announced the return of former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA<br/>

  Saavedra. The 2008 municipal elections were characterized by<br/>

  widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy -<br/>

  hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 -<br/>

  are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic institutions face new<br/>

  challenges under the ORTEGA administration.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86635">Niger<br/>

  Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced<br/>

  single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was<br/>

  forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which<br/>

  resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting<br/>

  brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by<br/>

  Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by<br/>

  military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections<br/>

  that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year.<br/>

  TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a<br/>

  constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as<br/>

  president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA,<br/>

  immediately suspended the constitution and dissolved the Cabinet,<br/>

  and promised that elections would be held following a transitional<br/>

  period of unspecified duration. Niger is one of the poorest<br/>

  countries in the world with minimal government services and<br/>

  insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely<br/>

  agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by<br/>

  extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. A<br/>

  predominately Tuareg ethnic group emerged in February 2007, the<br/>

  Nigerien Movement for Justice (MNJ), and attacked several military<br/>

  targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008.<br/>

  Successful government offensives in 2009 limited the rebels'<br/>

  operational capabilities.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86636">Nigeria<br/>

  British influence and control over what would become Nigeria<br/>

  and Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. A<br/>

  series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater<br/>

  autonomy; independence came in 1960. Following nearly 16 years of<br/>

  military rule, a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a<br/>

  peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The<br/>

  government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a<br/>

  petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through<br/>

  corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In<br/>

  addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and<br/>

  religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential<br/>

  elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence,<br/>

  Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian<br/>

  rule since independence. The general elections of April 2007 marked<br/>

  the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's<br/>

  history. In January 2010, Nigeria assumed a nonpermanent seat on the<br/>

  UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86637">Niue<br/>

  Niue's remoteness, as well as cultural and linguistic<br/>

  differences between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the rest<br/>

  of the Cook Islands, have caused it to be separately administered.<br/>

  The population of the island continues to drop (from a peak of 5,200<br/>

  in 1966 to an estimated 1,398 in 2009) with substantial emigration<br/>

  to New Zealand 2,400 km to the southwest.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86638">Norfolk Island<br/>

  Two British attempts at establishing the island as a<br/>

  penal colony (1788-1814 and 1825-55) were ultimately abandoned. In<br/>

  1856, the island was resettled by Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of<br/>

  the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86639">Northern Mariana Islands<br/>

  Under US administration as part of the UN<br/>

  Trust Territory of the Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana<br/>

  Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence but instead to<br/>

  forge closer links with the US. Negotiations for territorial status<br/>

  began in 1972. A covenant to establish a commonwealth in political<br/>

  union with the US was approved in 1975, and came into force on 24<br/>

  March 1976. A new government and constitution went into effect in<br/>

  1978.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86640">Norway<br/>

  Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off<br/>

  following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in<br/>

  994. Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next<br/>

  several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with<br/>

  Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians<br/>

  resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new<br/>

  constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway<br/>

  keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a<br/>

  Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to<br/>

  a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway<br/>

  remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its<br/>

  shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World<br/>

  War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany<br/>

  (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a<br/>

  member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the<br/>

  late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. The current focus is<br/>

  on containing spending on the extensive welfare system and planning<br/>

  for the time when petroleum reserves are depleted. In referenda held<br/>

  in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86641">Oman<br/>

  The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on<br/>

  Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, a newly established<br/>

  sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship<br/>

  treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British<br/>

  political and military advisors increased, but it never became a<br/>

  British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew the<br/>

  restrictive rule of his father; he has ruled as sultan ever since.<br/>

  His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the<br/>

  outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the<br/>

  UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to<br/>

  maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86642">Pacific Ocean<br/>

  The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five<br/>

  oceans (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern<br/>

  Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). Strategically important access waterways<br/>

  include the La Perouse, Tsugaru, Tsushima, Taiwan, Singapore, and<br/>

  Torres Straits. The decision by the International Hydrographic<br/>

  Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth ocean, the<br/>

  Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Pacific Ocean south of 60<br/>

  degrees south.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86643">Pakistan<br/>

  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the<br/>

  world and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what<br/>

  is presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants<br/>

  of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The<br/>

  area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the<br/>

  Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and<br/>

  Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries;<br/>

  the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The<br/>

  separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of<br/>

  Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was<br/>

  never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two<br/>

  wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A<br/>

  third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India<br/>

  capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani<br/>

  politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of<br/>

  Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan<br/>

  conducted its own tests in 1998. India-Pakistan relations have been<br/>

  rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, but both countries are<br/>

  taking small steps to put relations back on track. In February 2008,<br/>

  Pakistan held parliamentary elections and in September 2008, after<br/>

  the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF, elected Asif Ali<br/>

  ZARDARI to the presidency. Pakistani government and military leaders<br/>

  are struggling to control domestic insurgents, many of whom are<br/>

  located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86644">Palau<br/>

  After three decades as part of the UN Trust Territory of the<br/>

  Pacific under US administration, this westernmost cluster of the<br/>

  Caroline Islands opted for independence in 1978 rather than join the<br/>

  Federated States of Micronesia. A Compact of Free Association with<br/>

  the US was approved in 1986 but not ratified until 1993. It entered<br/>

  into force the following year when the islands gained independence.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86645">Panama<br/>

  Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century,<br/>

  Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia,<br/>

  Ecuador, and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When<br/>

  the latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With<br/>

  US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed<br/>

  a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US<br/>

  sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure<br/>

  (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army<br/>

  Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was<br/>

  signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama<br/>

  by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and<br/>

  increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the<br/>

  subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was<br/>

  deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the<br/>

  Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by<br/>

  the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious<br/>

  plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal. The<br/>

  project, which began in 2007 and could double the Canal's capacity,<br/>

  is expected to be completed in 2014-15.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86646">Papua New Guinea<br/>

  The eastern half of the island of New Guinea -<br/>

  second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north)<br/>

  and the UK (south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to<br/>

  Australia in 1902, which occupied the northern portion during World<br/>

  War I and continued to administer the combined areas until<br/>

  independence in 1975. A nine-year secessionist revolt on the island<br/>

  of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20,000 lives.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86647">Paracel Islands<br/>

  The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive<br/>

  fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932,<br/>

  French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on<br/>

  Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam.<br/>

  China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops<br/>

  seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands.<br/>

  China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield<br/>

  and artificial harbor. The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and<br/>

  Vietnam.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86648">Paraguay<br/>

  Paraguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811. In<br/>

  the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70) - between<br/>

  Paraguay and Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay - Paraguay lost<br/>

  two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory. The country<br/>

  stagnated economically for the next half century. Following the<br/>

  Chaco War of 1932-35 with Bolivia, Paraguay gained a large part of<br/>

  the Chaco lowland region. The 35-year military dictatorship of<br/>

  Alfredo STROESSNER ended in 1989, and, despite a marked increase in<br/>

  political infighting in recent years, Paraguay has held relatively<br/>

  free and regular presidential elections since then.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86649">Peru<br/>

  Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean<br/>

  civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was<br/>

  captured by the Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence<br/>

  was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces defeated in 1824.<br/>

  After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic<br/>

  leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth<br/>

  of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in<br/>

  1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the<br/>

  economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity.<br/>

  Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian<br/>

  measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting<br/>

  dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his ouster in 2000. A<br/>

  caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001,<br/>

  which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of<br/>

  government - Peru's first democratically elected president of Native<br/>

  American ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return<br/>

  of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term<br/>

  from 1985 to 1990, has overseen a robust macroeconomic performance.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86650">Philippines<br/>

  The Philippine Islands became a Spanish colony during<br/>

  the 16th century; they were ceded to the US in 1898 following the<br/>

  Spanish-American War. In 1935 the Philippines became a<br/>

  self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president and<br/>

  was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a<br/>

  10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese<br/>

  occupation during World War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought<br/>

  together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the<br/>

  Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. A 20-year<br/>

  rule by Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a "people power"<br/>

  movement in Manila ("EDSA 1") forced him into exile and installed<br/>

  Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several<br/>

  coup attempts that prevented a return to full political stability<br/>

  and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992.<br/>

  His administration was marked by increased stability and by progress<br/>

  on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases<br/>

  on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998. He was<br/>

  succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January<br/>

  2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges<br/>

  broke down and another "people power" movement ("EDSA 2") demanded<br/>

  his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as<br/>

  president in May 2004. Her presidency was marred by several<br/>

  corruption allegations but the Philippine economy was one of the few<br/>

  to avoid contraction following the 2008 global financial crisis,<br/>

  expanding each year of her administration. Benigno AQUINO III was<br/>

  elected to a six-year term as president in May 2010. The Philippine<br/>

  Government faces threats from several groups on the US Government's<br/>

  Foreign Terrorist Organization list. Manila has waged a decades-long<br/>

  struggle against ethnic Moro insurgencies in the southern<br/>

  Philippines, which has led to a peace accord with the Moro National<br/>

  Liberation Front and on-again/off-again peace talks with the Moro<br/>

  Islamic Liberation Front. The decades-long Maoist-inspired New<br/>

  Peoples' Army insurgency also operates through much of the country.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86651">Pitcairn Islands<br/>

  Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the<br/>

  British and settled in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers and their<br/>

  Tahitian companions. Pitcairn was the first Pacific island to become<br/>

  a British colony (in 1838) and today remains the last vestige of<br/>

  that empire in the South Pacific. Outmigration, primarily to New<br/>

  Zealand, has thinned the population from a peak of 233 in 1937 to<br/>

  less than 50 today.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86652">Poland<br/>

  Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the<br/>

  middle of the 10th century. Its golden age occurred in the 16th<br/>

  century. During the following century, the strengthening of the<br/>

  gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of<br/>

  agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria<br/>

  partitioned Poland amongst themselves. Poland regained its<br/>

  independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet<br/>

  Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following<br/>

  the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and<br/>

  progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the<br/>

  independent trade union "Solidarity" that over time became a<br/>

  political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and<br/>

  the presidency. A "shock therapy" program during the early 1990s<br/>

  enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most<br/>

  robust in Central Europe, but Poland still faces the lingering<br/>

  challenges of high unemployment, underdeveloped and dilapidated<br/>

  infrastructure, and a poor rural underclass. Solidarity suffered a<br/>

  major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to<br/>

  elect a single deputy to the lower house of Parliament, and the new<br/>

  leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union subsequently pledged to reduce<br/>

  the Trade Union's political role. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the<br/>

  European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic,<br/>

  market-oriented country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly<br/>

  active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86653">Portugal<br/>

  Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the<br/>

  15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status<br/>

  with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation<br/>

  during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of its wealthiest<br/>

  colony of Brazil in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy;<br/>

  for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the<br/>

  country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad<br/>

  democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted<br/>

  independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding<br/>

  member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986. In January<br/>

  2011, Portugal assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security<br/>

  Council for the 2011-12 term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86654">Puerto Rico<br/>

  Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the<br/>

  island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following COLUMBUS'<br/>

  second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial<br/>

  rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and<br/>

  African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a<br/>

  result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US<br/>

  citizenship in 1917. Popularly-elected governors have served since<br/>

  1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal<br/>

  self government. In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters<br/>

  chose not to alter the existing political status.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86655">Qatar<br/>

  Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar<br/>

  transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for<br/>

  pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural<br/>

  gas revenues. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari<br/>

  economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum<br/>

  revenues by the Amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son,<br/>

  the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew him in a<br/>

  bloodless coup in 1995. In 2001, Qatar resolved its longstanding<br/>

  border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, oil<br/>

  and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the<br/>

  second-highest per capita income in the world.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86656">Romania<br/>

  The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries<br/>

  under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their<br/>

  autonomy in 1856; they united in 1859 and a few years later adopted<br/>

  the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its<br/>

  independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and<br/>

  acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the<br/>

  conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and<br/>

  participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years<br/>

  later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The<br/>

  post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a Communist<br/>

  "people's republic" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The<br/>

  decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in<br/>

  1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive<br/>

  and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and<br/>

  executed in late 1989. Former Communists dominated the government<br/>

  until 1996 when they were swept from power. Romania joined NATO in<br/>

  2004 and the EU in 2007.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86657">Russia<br/>

  Founded in the 12th century, the Principality of Muscovy, was<br/>

  able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination (13th-15th<br/>

  centuries) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding<br/>

  principalities. In the early 17th century, a new Romanov Dynasty<br/>

  continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific.<br/>

  Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725), hegemony was extended to the Baltic<br/>

  Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th<br/>

  century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia.<br/>

  Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the<br/>

  Revolution of 1905, which resulted in the formation of a parliament<br/>

  and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army<br/>

  in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the<br/>

  Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial<br/>

  household. The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon<br/>

  after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53)<br/>

  strengthened Communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet<br/>

  Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet economy and<br/>

  society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary<br/>

  Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and<br/>

  perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize Communism,<br/>

  but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December<br/>

  1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent<br/>

  republics. Since then, Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic<br/>

  ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state whose<br/>

  legitimacy is buttressed, in part, by carefully managed national<br/>

  elections, former President PUTIN's genuine popularity, and the<br/>

  prudent management of Russia's windfall energy wealth. Russia has<br/>

  severely disabled a Chechen rebel movement, although violence still<br/>

  occurs throughout the North Caucasus.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86658">Rwanda<br/>

  In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the<br/>

  majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king.<br/>

  Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and<br/>

  some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The<br/>

  children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan<br/>

  Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along<br/>

  with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic<br/>

  tensions, culminating in April 1994 in the genocide of roughly<br/>

  800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Tutsi rebels defeated the<br/>

  Hutu regime and ended the killing in July 1994, but approximately 2<br/>

  million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to<br/>

  neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. Since then, most<br/>

  of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand<br/>

  remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC;<br/>

  the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on<br/>

  retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF tried in 1990. Rwanda held its<br/>

  first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide<br/>

  presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009<br/>

  staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to<br/>

  rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa<br/>

  restored diplomatic relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth<br/>

  in late 2009.<br/>

<p id="id86659">Saint Barthelemy<br/>

  Discovered in 1493 by Christopher COLUMBUS who<br/>

  named it for his brother Bartolomeo, Saint Barthelemy was first<br/>

  settled by the French in 1648. In 1784, the French sold the island<br/>

  to Sweden, who renamed the largest town Gustavia, after the Swedish<br/>

  King GUSTAV III, and made it a free port; the island prospered as a<br/>

  trade and supply center during the colonial wars of the 18th<br/>

  century. France repurchased the island in 1878 and placed it under<br/>

  the administration of Guadeloupe. Saint Barthelemy retained its free<br/>

  port status along with various Swedish appellations such as Swedish<br/>

  street and town names, and the three-crown symbol on the coat of<br/>

  arms. In 2003, the populace of the island voted to secede from<br/>

  Guadeloupe and in 2007, the island became a French overseas<br/>

  collectivity.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86660">Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha<br/>

  Saint Helena is a<br/>

  British Overseas Territory consisting of Saint Helena and Ascension<br/>

  Islands, and the island group of Tristan da Cunha.<br/>

  Saint Helena: Uninhabited when first discovered by the Portuguese in<br/>

  1502, Saint Helena was garrisoned by the British during the 17th<br/>

  century. It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile<br/>

  from 1815 until his death in 1821, but its importance as a port of<br/>

  call declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During<br/>

  the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, several thousand Boer prisoners<br/>

  were confined on the island between 1900 and 1903.<br/>

  Ascension Island: This barren and uninhabited island was discovered<br/>

  and named by the Portuguese in 1503. The British garrisoned the<br/>

  island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena. It<br/>

  served as a provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa<br/>

  Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty<br/>

  control until 1922, when it became a dependency of Saint Helena.<br/>

  During World War II, the UK permitted the US to construct an<br/>

  airfield on Ascension in support of trans-Atlantic flights to Africa<br/>

  and anti-submarine operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s<br/>

  the island became an important space tracking station for the US. In<br/>

  1982, Ascension was an essential staging area for British forces<br/>

  during the Falklands War. It remains a critical refueling point in<br/>

  the air-bridge from the UK to the South Atlantic.<br/>

  Tristan da Cunha: The island group consists of the islands of<br/>

  Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough. Tristan da<br/>

  Cunha is named after its Portuguese discoverer (1506); it was<br/>

  garrisoned by the British in 1816 to prevent any attempt to rescue<br/>

  Napoleon from Saint Helena. Gough and Inaccessible Islands have been<br/>

  designated World Heritage Sites. South Africa leases a site for a<br/>

  meteorological station on Gough Island.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86661">Saint Kitts and Nevis<br/>

  Carib Indians occupied the islands for<br/>

  hundreds of years before the British began settlement in 1623. The<br/>

  islands became an associated state of the UK with full internal<br/>

  autonomy in 1967. The island of Anguilla rebelled and was allowed to<br/>

  secede in 1971. Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983.<br/>

  In 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from Saint<br/>

  Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. Nevis continues<br/>

  in its efforts to separate from Saint Kitts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86662">Saint Lucia<br/>

  The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries,<br/>

  was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and<br/>

  early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally<br/>

  ceded to the UK in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its<br/>

  plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island,<br/>

  dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was<br/>

  granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86663">Saint Martin<br/>

  Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and<br/>

  claimed for Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631<br/>

  and set about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the<br/>

  island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The<br/>

  Spanish finally relinquished Saint Martin to the French and Dutch,<br/>

  who divided it amongst themselves in 1648. Friction between the two<br/>

  sides caused the border to frequently fluctuate over the next two<br/>

  centuries, with the French eventually holding the greater portion of<br/>

  the island (about 57%). The cultivation of sugar cane introduced<br/>

  slavery to the island in the late 18th century; the practice was not<br/>

  abolished until 1848. The island became a free port in 1939; the<br/>

  tourism industry was dramatically expanded during the 1970s and<br/>

  1980s. In 2003, the populace of Saint Martin voted to secede from<br/>

  Guadeloupe and in 2007, the northern portion of the island became a<br/>

  French overseas collectivity.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86664">Saint Pierre and Miquelon<br/>

  First settled by the French in the early<br/>

  17th century, the islands represent the sole remaining vestige of<br/>

  France's once vast North American possessions.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86665">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines<br/>

  Resistance by native Caribs<br/>

  prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719. Disputed between<br/>

  France and the United Kingdom for most of the 18th century, the<br/>

  island was ceded to the latter in 1783. Between 1960 and 1962, Saint<br/>

  Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the<br/>

  Federation of the West Indies. Autonomy was granted in 1969 and<br/>

  independence in 1979.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86666">Samoa<br/>

  New Zealand occupied the German protectorate of Western Samoa<br/>

  at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It continued to administer<br/>

  the islands as a mandate and then as a trust territory until 1962,<br/>

  when the islands became the first Polynesian nation to reestablish<br/>

  independence in the 20th century. The country dropped the "Western"<br/>

  from its name in 1997.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86667">San Marino<br/>

  The third smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See<br/>

  and Monaco), San Marino also claims to be the world's oldest<br/>

  republic. According to tradition, it was founded by a Christian<br/>

  stonemason named Marinus in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is<br/>

  aligned with that of Italy; social and political trends in the<br/>

  republic also track closely with those of its larger neighbor.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86668">Sao Tome and Principe<br/>

  Discovered and claimed by Portugal in the late<br/>

  15th century, the islands' sugar-based economy gave way to coffee<br/>

  and cocoa in the 19th century - all grown with plantation slave<br/>

  labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th century. While<br/>

  independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not<br/>

  instituted until the late 1980s. The country held its first free<br/>

  elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling between the<br/>

  various political parties precipitated repeated changes in<br/>

  leadership and two failed coup attempts in 1995 and 2003. The recent<br/>

  discovery of oil in the Gulf of Guinea promises to attract increased<br/>

  attention to the small island nation.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86669">Saudi Arabia<br/>

  Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to<br/>

  Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official<br/>

  title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi<br/>

  state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD<br/>

  (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian<br/>

  Peninsula. A male descendent of Ibn Saud, his son ABDALLAH bin Abd<br/>

  al-Aziz, rules the country today as required by the country's 1992<br/>

  Basic Law. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia<br/>

  accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while<br/>

  allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the<br/>

  liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of<br/>

  foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a<br/>

  source of tension between the royal family and the public until all<br/>

  operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist<br/>

  attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign<br/>

  against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has<br/>

  continued the cautious reform program begun when he was crown<br/>

  prince. To promote increased political participation, the government<br/>

  held elections nationwide from February through April 2005 for half<br/>

  the members of 179 municipal councils. In December 2005, King<br/>

  ABDALLAH completed the process by appointing the remaining members<br/>

  of the advisory municipal councils. The king instituted an<br/>

  Inter-Faith Dialogue initiative in 2008 to encourage religious<br/>

  tolerance on a global level; in February 2009, he reshuffled the<br/>

  cabinet, which led to more moderates holding ministerial and<br/>

  judicial positions, and appointed the first female to the cabinet.<br/>

  The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and<br/>

  holds more than 20% of the world's proven oil reserves. The<br/>

  government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification,<br/>

  particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in December<br/>

  2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning<br/>

  population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on<br/>

  petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86670">Senegal<br/>

  The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were<br/>

  merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation<br/>

  in 1960. The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined<br/>

  with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in<br/>

  1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never<br/>

  carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of<br/>

  Democratic Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level<br/>

  separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and<br/>

  several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict.<br/>

  Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in<br/>

  Africa. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until<br/>

  current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000. He was<br/>

  reelected in February 2007 and has amended Senegal's constitution<br/>

  over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the<br/>

  opposition, part of the President's increasingly autocratic<br/>

  governing style. Senegal has a long history of participating in<br/>

  international peacekeeping and regional mediation.<br/>
