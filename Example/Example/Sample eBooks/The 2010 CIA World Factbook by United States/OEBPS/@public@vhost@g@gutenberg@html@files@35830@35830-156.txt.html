  The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in
  1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Various
  paramilitary bands resisted Nazi Germany's occupation and division
  of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945, but fought each other and ethnic
  opponents as much as the invaders. The military and political
  movement headed by Josip "TITO" Broz (Partisans) took full control
  of Yugoslavia when German and Croatian separatist forces were
  defeated in 1945. Although Communist, TITO's new government and his
  successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between
  the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half
  decades. In 1989, Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the
  Republic of Serbia and his ultranationalist calls for Serbian
  domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic
  lines. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declared
  independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining republics of
  Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
  (FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia led
  various military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring
  republics into a "Greater Serbia." These actions led to Yugoslavia
  being ousted from the UN in 1992, but Serbia continued its -
  ultimately unsuccessful - campaign until signing the Dayton Peace
  Accords in 1995. MILOSEVIC kept tight control over Serbia and
  eventually became president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998, an ethnic
  Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of
  Kosovo provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted
  in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in
  Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed
  international settlement led to NATO's bombing of Serbia in the
  spring of 1999, to the withdrawal of Serbian military and police
  forces from Kosovo in June 1999, and to the stationing of a NATO-led
  force in Kosovo to provide a safe and secure environment for the
  region's ethnic communities. FRY elections in late 2000 led to the
  ouster of MILOSEVIC and the installation of democratic government.
  MILOSEVIC was arrested in 2001 and sent to be tried in The Hague for
  crimes against humanity; he died in March 2006 before the completion
  of his trial. In 2001, the country's suspension from the UN was
  lifted. In 2003, the FRY became Serbia and Montenegro, a loose
  federation of the two republics with a federal level parliament.
  Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo
  in March 2004 caused the international community to open
  negotiations on the future status of Kosovo in January 2006. In May
  2006, Montenegro invoked its right to secede from the federation and
  - following a successful referendum - it declared itself an
  independent nation on 3 June 2006. Two days later, Serbia declared
  that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and
  Montenegro. A new Serbian constitution was approved in October 2006
  and adopted the following month. In February 2008, after nearly two
  years of inconclusive negotiations, the UN-administered province of
  Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia - an action Serbia
  refuses to recognize. At Serbia's request, the UN General Assembly
  (UNGA) in October 2008 sought an advisory opinion from the
  International Court of Justice (ICJ) on whether Kosovo's unilateral
  declaration of independence was in accordance with international
  law. In a ruling considered unfavorable to Serbia, the ICJ issued an
  advisory opinion in July 2010 stating that international law did not
  prohibit declarations of independence. In late 2010, Serbia agreed
  to an EU-drafted UNGA Resolution acknowledging the ICJ's decision
  and calling for a new round of talks between Serbia and Kosovo.</p>

<p id="id86672">Seychelles<br/>

  A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for<br/>

  the islands ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the latter.<br/>

  Independence came in 1976. Socialist rule was brought to a close<br/>

  with a new constitution and free elections in 1993. President<br/>

  France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was re-elected in<br/>

  2001, but stepped down in 2004. Vice President James MICHEL took<br/>

  over the presidency and in July 2006 was elected to a new five-year<br/>

  term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86673">Sierra Leone<br/>

  Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil<br/>

  war from 1991 to 2002 that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths<br/>

  and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about one-third<br/>

  of the population). The military, which took over full<br/>

  responsibility for security following the departure of UN<br/>

  peacekeepers at the end of 2005, is increasingly developing as a<br/>

  guarantor of the country's stability. The armed forces remained on<br/>

  the sideline during the 2007 presidential election, but still look<br/>

  to the UN Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) - a civilian<br/>

  UN mission - to support efforts to consolidate peace. The new<br/>

  government's priorities include furthering development, creating<br/>

  jobs, and stamping out endemic corruption.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86674">Singapore<br/>

  Singapore was founded as a British trading colony in 1819.<br/>

  It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but separated two years<br/>

  later and became independent. Singapore subsequently became one of<br/>

  the world's most prosperous countries with strong international<br/>

  trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of<br/>

  tonnage handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the<br/>

  leading nations of Western Europe.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86675">Sint Maarten<br/>

  Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and<br/>

  claimed for Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631<br/>

  and set about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the<br/>

  island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The<br/>

  Spanish finally relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the<br/>

  French and Dutch, who divided it amongst themselves in 1648. The<br/>

  establishment of cotton, tobacco, and sugar plantations dramatically<br/>

  expanded slavery on the island in the 18th and 19th centuries; the<br/>

  practice was not abolished in the Dutch half until 1863. The<br/>

  island's economy declined until 1939 when it became a free port; the<br/>

  tourism industry was dramatically expanded beginning in the 1950s.<br/>

  In 1954, Sint Maarten and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions<br/>

  became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as the Netherlands<br/>

  Antilles. In a 2000 referendum, the citizens of Sint Maarten voted<br/>

  to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the<br/>

  Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October of<br/>

  2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86676">Slovakia<br/>

  The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close<br/>

  of World War I allowed the Slovaks to join the closely related<br/>

  Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II,<br/>

  Czechoslovakia became a Communist nation within Soviet-dominated<br/>

  Eastern Europe. Soviet influence collapsed in 1989 and<br/>

  Czechoslovakia once more became free. The Slovaks and the Czechs<br/>

  agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993. Slovakia joined<br/>

  both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro area on 1<br/>

  January 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86677">Slovenia<br/>

  The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire<br/>

  until the latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918,<br/>

  the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new<br/>

  multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World<br/>

  War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which<br/>

  though Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied<br/>

  with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes<br/>

  succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short<br/>

  10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and<br/>

  a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a<br/>

  modern state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring<br/>

  of 2004; it joined the eurozone in 2007.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86678">Solomon Islands<br/>

  The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon<br/>

  Islands in the 1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of World War<br/>

  II occurred on this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in<br/>

  1976 and independence two years later. Ethnic violence, government<br/>

  malfeasance, and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil<br/>

  society. In June 2003, then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought<br/>

  the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order; the<br/>

  following month, an Australian-led multinational force arrived to<br/>

  restore peace and disarm ethnic militias. The Regional Assistance<br/>

  Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has generally been effective<br/>

  in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86679" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Somalia
  Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow
  its protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new
  nation of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre
  ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the
  persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and
  dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia
  descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May
  1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland
  that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi
  Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any
  government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and
  continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including
  holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The
  regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring
  semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing
  since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made
  strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative
  government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its
  border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool
  and Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort
  (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions,
  but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant
  casualties, order still had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia
  National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the
  formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional
  National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate
  security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under
  the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
  (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October
  2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a
  second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal
  Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a
  275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal
  Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United
  Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance
  for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In
  January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government,
  Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December
  2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition
  Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was
  increased to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil
  society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected
  Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former CIC and ARS chairman as
  president on 31 January 2009, in Djibouti. Subsequently, President
  SHARIF appointed Omar Abdirashid ali SHARMARKE, son of a former
  president of Somalia, as prime minister on 13 February 2009.
  SHARMARKE resigned in September 2010 and was replaced by Mohamed
  Abdullahi MOHAMED, aka Farmajo, a dual US-Somali citizen that lived
  in the United Stated from 1985 until his return to Somalia in
  October 2010. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional
  Federal Charter (TFC), which outlines a five-year mandate leading to
  the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a
  representative government following national elections. However, in
  January 2009 the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until
  2011.</p>

<p id="id86680" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">South Africa
  Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day
  South Africa in 1652 and established a stopover point on the spice
  route between the Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of
  Cape Town. After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in
  1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found
  their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold
  (1886) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the
  subjugation of the native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British
  encroachments but were defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902);
  however, the British and the Afrikaners, as the Boers became known,
  ruled together beginning in 1910 under the Union of South Africa,
  which became a republic in 1961 after a whites-only referendum. In
  1948, the National Party was voted into power and instituted a
  policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races - which
  favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority. The
  African National Congress (ANC) led the opposition to apartheid and
  many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson MANDELA, spent decades in South
  Africa's prisons. Internal protests and insurgency, as well as
  boycotts by some Western nations and institutions, led to the
  regime's eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to
  majority rule. The first multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an
  end to apartheid and ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led
  government. South Africa since then has struggled to address
  apartheid-era imbalances in decent housing, education, and health
  care. ANC infighting, which has grown in recent years, came to a
  head in September 2008 when President Thabo MBEKI resigned, and
  Kgalema MOTLANTHE, the party's General-Secretary, succeeded him as
  interim president. Jacob ZUMA became president after the ANC won
  general elections in April 2009. In January 2011, South Africa
  assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the
  2011-12 term.</p>

<p id="id86681">South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands<br/>

  The islands, which have<br/>

  large bird and seal populations, lie approximately 1,000 km east of<br/>

  the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration<br/>

  since 1908 - except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina<br/>

  occupied them. Grytviken, on South Georgia, was a 19th and early<br/>

  20th century whaling station. Famed explorer Ernest SHACKLETON<br/>

  stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated attempt to cross<br/>

  Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months later with a few<br/>

  companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue for the<br/>

  rest of his crew, stranded off the Antarctic Peninsula. He died in<br/>

  1922 on a subsequent expedition and is buried in Grytviken. Today,<br/>

  the station houses scientists from the British Antarctic Survey.<br/>

  Recognizing the importance of preserving the marine stocks in<br/>

  adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993, extended the exclusive fishing<br/>

  zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around each island.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86682">Southern Ocean<br/>

  A large body of recent oceanographic research has<br/>

  shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), an ocean current<br/>

  that flows from west to east around Antarctica, plays a crucial role<br/>

  in global ocean circulation. The region where the cold waters of the<br/>

  ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a<br/>

  distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with<br/>

  the seasons, but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a<br/>

  unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients,<br/>

  which promotes marine plant life, and which in turn allows for a<br/>

  greater abundance of animal life. In the spring of 2000, the<br/>

  International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the<br/>

  waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern<br/>

  Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean,<br/>

  Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the<br/>

  coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude, which<br/>

  coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the<br/>

  extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such, the Southern Ocean is<br/>

  now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific<br/>

  Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, but larger than the Arctic<br/>

  Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does<br/>

  not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary<br/>

  oceans by the US Government.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86683">Spain<br/>

  Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries<br/>

  ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent<br/>

  failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused<br/>

  the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic<br/>

  and political power. Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II<br/>

  but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful<br/>

  transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco<br/>

  FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the<br/>

  EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and<br/>

  made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. The<br/>

  government continues to battle the Basque Fatherland and Liberty<br/>

  (ETA) terrorist organization, but its major focus for the immediate<br/>

  future will be on measures to reverse the severe economic recession<br/>

  that started in mid-2008.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86684">Spratly Islands<br/>

  The Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small<br/>

  islands or reefs. They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and<br/>

  potentially by gas and oil deposits. They are claimed in their<br/>

  entirety by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed<br/>

  by Malaysia and the Philippines. About 45 islands are occupied by<br/>

  relatively small numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia,<br/>

  the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Brunei has established a<br/>

  fishing zone that overlaps a southern reef but has not made any<br/>

  formal claim.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86685">Sri Lanka<br/>

  The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th<br/>

  century B.C. probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced<br/>

  in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization<br/>

  developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C.<br/>

  to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In<br/>

  the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom<br/>

  in northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were<br/>

  controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in<br/>

  the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796,<br/>

  became a crown colony in 1802, and was united under British rule by<br/>

  1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed<br/>

  to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and<br/>

  Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. After two decades of<br/>

  fighting, the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)<br/>

  formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace<br/>

  negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces<br/>

  intensified in 2006 and the government regained control of the<br/>

  Eastern Province in 2007. In May 2009, the government announced that<br/>

  its military had finally defeated the remnants of the LTTE and that<br/>

  its leader, Velupillai PRABHAKARAN, had been killed.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86686">Sudan<br/>

  Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have<br/>

  dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956.<br/>

  Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the<br/>

  remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in<br/>

  northern economic, political, and social domination of largely<br/>

  non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in<br/>

  1972 but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related<br/>

  effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and,<br/>

  according to rebel estimates, more than two million deaths over a<br/>

  period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with<br/>

  the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive<br/>

  Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern<br/>

  rebels autonomy for six years. After which, a referendum for<br/>

  independence is scheduled to be held. A separate conflict, which<br/>

  broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003, has displaced<br/>

  nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200,000 to 400,000<br/>

  deaths. The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation<br/>

  from the African Union on 31 December 2007. As of early 2009,<br/>

  peacekeeping troops were struggling to stabilize the situation,<br/>

  which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought<br/>

  instability to eastern Chad. Sudan also has faced large refugee<br/>

  influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad.<br/>

  Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and lack of<br/>

  government support have chronically obstructed the provision of<br/>

  humanitarian assistance to affected populations.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86687">Suriname<br/>

  First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and<br/>

  then settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became<br/>

  a Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of slavery in 1863,<br/>

  workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the<br/>

  Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian<br/>

  government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a<br/>

  socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a<br/>

  succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when<br/>

  international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In<br/>

  1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a<br/>

  democratically elected government - a four-party coalition -<br/>

  returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties<br/>

  in 2005 and has continued to rule since.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86688">Svalbard<br/>

  First discovered by the Norwegians in the 12th century, the<br/>

  islands served as an international whaling base during the 17th and<br/>

  18th centuries. Norway's sovereignty was recognized in 1920; five<br/>

  years later it officially took over the territory.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86689">Swaziland<br/>

  Autonomy for the Swazis of southern Africa was guaranteed<br/>

  by the British in the late 19th century; independence was granted in<br/>

  1968. Student and labor unrest during the 1990s pressured King<br/>

  MSWATI III, the world's last absolute monarch, to grudgingly allow<br/>

  political reform and greater democracy, although he has backslid on<br/>

  these promises in recent years. A constitution came into effect in<br/>

  2006, but political parties remain banned. The African United<br/>

  Democratic Party tried unsuccessfully to register as an official<br/>

  political party in mid 2006. Talks over the constitution broke down<br/>

  between the government and progressive groups in 2007. Swaziland<br/>

  recently surpassed Botswana as the country with the world's highest<br/>

  known HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86690">Sweden<br/>

  A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not<br/>

  participated in any war for almost two centuries. An armed<br/>

  neutrality was preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's<br/>

  long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded<br/>

  with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by<br/>

  high unemployment and in 2000-02 and 2009 by the global economic<br/>

  downturns, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has<br/>

  allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the<br/>

  EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in<br/>

  a 2003 referendum.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86691">Switzerland<br/>

  The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a<br/>

  defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other<br/>

  localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation<br/>

  secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A<br/>

  constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874, replaced the<br/>

  confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's<br/>

  sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major<br/>

  European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the<br/>

  two World Wars. The political and economic integration of Europe<br/>

  over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN<br/>

  and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties<br/>

  with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a<br/>

  UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and<br/>

  international organizations but retains a strong commitment to<br/>

  neutrality.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86692">Syria<br/>

  Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the<br/>

  northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The<br/>

  French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence<br/>

  in 1946. The new country lacked political stability, however, and<br/>

  experienced a series of military coups during its first decades.<br/>

  Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab<br/>

  Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the<br/>

  Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz<br/>

  al-ASAD, a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority<br/>

  Alawite sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political<br/>

  stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost<br/>

  the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held<br/>

  occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of<br/>

  President al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as<br/>

  president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops -<br/>

  stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role -<br/>

  were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict<br/>

  between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on<br/>

  alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally<br/>

  Hizballah. In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD was elected to his second term<br/>

  as president.<br/>

<p id="id86693">Taiwan<br/>

  In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to<br/>

  Japan. Taiwan reverted to Chinese control after World War II.<br/>

  Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million<br/>

  Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the<br/>

  1947 constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five<br/>

  decades, the ruling authorities gradually democratized and<br/>

  incorporated the local population within the governing structure. In<br/>

  2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the<br/>

  Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this<br/>

  period, the island prospered and became one of East Asia's economic<br/>

  "Tigers." The dominant political issues continue to be the<br/>

  relationship between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of<br/>

  Taiwan's eventual status - as well as domestic political and<br/>

  economic reform.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86694">Tajikistan<br/>

  The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and<br/>

  1870s, but Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the<br/>

  Revolution of 1917. Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely<br/>

  contested and not fully reestablished until 1925. Much of<br/>

  present-day Sughd province was transferred from the Uzbek SSR to the<br/>

  newly formed Tajik SSR in 1929. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial<br/>

  minority in Sughd province. Tajikistan became independent in 1991<br/>

  following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and experienced a civil<br/>

  war between regional factions from 1992-97. There have been no major<br/>

  security incidents in recent years, although the country remains the<br/>

  poorest in the former Soviet sphere. Attention by the international<br/>

  community since the beginning of the NATO intervention in<br/>

  Afghanistan has brought increased economic development and security<br/>

  assistance, which could create jobs and strengthen stability in the<br/>

  long term. Tajikistan is in the early stages of seeking World Trade<br/>

  Organization membership and has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86695">Tanzania<br/>

  Shortly after achieving independence from Britain in the<br/>

  early 1960s, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form the nation of<br/>

  Tanzania in 1964. One-party rule came to an end in 1995 with the<br/>

  first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s.<br/>

  Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition have led to<br/>

  two contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won<br/>

  despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86696">Thailand<br/>

  A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th<br/>

  century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast<br/>

  Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A<br/>

  bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In<br/>

  alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US treaty<br/>

  ally following the conflict. A military coup in September 2006<br/>

  ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat. The interim government<br/>

  held elections in December 2007 that saw the former pro-THAKSIN<br/>

  People's Power Party (PPP) emerge at the head of a coalition<br/>

  government. The anti-THAKSIN People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD)<br/>

  in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government,<br/>

  eventually occupying the prime minister's office in August and<br/>

  Bangkok's two international airports in November. The PAD ended<br/>

  their protests in early December 2008 following a court ruling that<br/>

  dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for<br/>

  election violations. The Democrat Party then formed a new coalition<br/>

  government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister. In October<br/>

  2008 THAKSIN went into voluntary exile to avoid imprisonment for a<br/>

  corruption conviction, and has since agitated his followers from<br/>

  abroad. THAKSIN supporters re-organized into the United Front for<br/>

  Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) and rioted in April 2009,<br/>

  shutting down an ASEAN meeting in Phuket, and in early 2010<br/>

  protested a court verdict confiscating most of THAKSIN's wealth.<br/>

  Between March and May 2010, the UDD staged large protests and<br/>

  occupied several blocks of downtown Bangkok. A government operation<br/>

  to disperse the protesters after nine weeks led to clashes that<br/>

  resulted in 89 deaths and an estimated $1.5 billion in arson-related<br/>

  property losses. These protests exposed major cleavages in the Thai<br/>

  body politic which continue to hamper the current government. Since<br/>

  January 2004, thousands have been killed as separatists in<br/>

  Thailand's southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces increased the<br/>

  violence associated with their cause.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86697">Timor-Leste<br/>

  The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor<br/>

  in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century.<br/>

  Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an<br/>

  1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the<br/>

  island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945,<br/>

  but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in<br/>

  World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal<br/>

  on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian<br/>

  forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July<br/>

  1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful<br/>

  campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during<br/>

  which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives.<br/>

  On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an<br/>

  overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for<br/>

  independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival<br/>

  of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999,<br/>

  anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the<br/>

  Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth<br/>

  campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400<br/>

  Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into western Timor as<br/>

  refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including<br/>

  homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and<br/>

  nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20<br/>

  September 1999, the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the<br/>

  International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the<br/>

  country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002,<br/>

  Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state.<br/>

  In late April 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's<br/>

  security when a military strike led to violence and a near breakdown<br/>

  of law and order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International<br/>

  Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste in late May. In<br/>

  August, the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated<br/>

  Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police<br/>

  presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored<br/>

  stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in<br/>

  April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February<br/>

  2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the<br/>

  president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the<br/>

  attack and the majority of the rebels surrendered in April 2008.<br/>

  Since the unsuccessful attacks the government has enjoyed one of its<br/>

  longest periods of post-independence stability.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86698">Togo<br/>

  French Togoland became Togo in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA,<br/>

  installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand<br/>

  for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multiparty elections<br/>

  instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated<br/>

  by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party<br/>

  has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a<br/>

  majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in<br/>

  February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure<br/>

  GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months<br/>

  later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first<br/>

  relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007.<br/>

  After years of political unrest and condemnation from international<br/>

  organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being<br/>

  re-welcomed into the international community.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86699">Tokelau<br/>

  Originally settled by Polynesian emigrants from surrounding<br/>

  island groups, the Tokelau Islands were made a British protectorate<br/>

  in 1889. They were transferred to New Zealand administration in<br/>

  1925. Referenda held in 2006 and 2007 to change the status of the<br/>

  islands from that of a New Zealand territory to one of free<br/>

  association with New Zealand did not meet the needed threshold for<br/>

  approval.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86700">Tonga<br/>

  Tonga - unique among Pacific nations - never completely lost<br/>

  its indigenous governance. The archipelagos of "The Friendly<br/>

  Islands" were united into a Polynesian kingdom in 1845. Tonga became<br/>

  a constitutional monarchy in 1875 and a British protectorate in<br/>

  1900; it withdrew from the protectorate and joined the Commonwealth<br/>

  of Nations in 1970. Tonga remains the only monarchy in the Pacific.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86701">Trinidad and Tobago<br/>

  First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came<br/>

  under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar<br/>

  industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834.<br/>

  Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from<br/>

  India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well<br/>

  as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910<br/>

  added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962.<br/>

  The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks<br/>

  largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.<br/>

  Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing.<br/>

  The government is coping with a rise in violent crime.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86702">Tunisia<br/>

  Rivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia<br/>

  culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a<br/>

  protectorate. Agitation for independence in the decades following<br/>

  World War I was finally successful in getting the French to<br/>

  recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's<br/>

  first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party<br/>

  state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic<br/>

  fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any<br/>

  other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from<br/>

  office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup.<br/>

  BEN ALI is currently serving his fifth consecutive five-year term as<br/>

  president. Tunisia has long taken a moderate, non-aligned stance in<br/>

  its foreign relations. Domestically, it has sought to defuse rising<br/>

  pressure for a more open political society.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86703">Turkey<br/>

  Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants<br/>

  of the defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who<br/>

  was later honored with the title Ataturk or "Father of the Turks."<br/>

  Under his authoritarian leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging<br/>

  social, legal, and political reforms. After a period of one-party<br/>

  rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950<br/>

  election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful<br/>

  transfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have<br/>

  multiplied, but democracy has been fractured by periods of<br/>

  instability and intermittent military coups (1960, 1971, 1980),<br/>

  which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political<br/>

  power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the<br/>

  ouster - popularly dubbed a "post-modern coup" - of the then<br/>

  Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus<br/>

  in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since<br/>

  acted as patron state to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"<br/>

  which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984<br/>

  by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's<br/>

  Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the<br/>

  Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives.<br/>

  After the capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents<br/>

  largely withdrew from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004, KGK<br/>

  announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK<br/>

  increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a<br/>

  member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the<br/>

  European Community. Over the past decade, it has undertaken many<br/>

  reforms to strengthen its democracy and economy; it began accession<br/>

  membership talks with the European Union in 2005.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86704">Turkmenistan<br/>

  Eastern Turkmenistan for centuries formed part of the<br/>

  Persian province of Khurasan; in medieval times Merv (today known as<br/>

  Mary) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an<br/>

  important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia between 1865 and<br/>

  1885, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic in 1924. It achieved<br/>

  independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Extensive<br/>

  hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this<br/>

  underdeveloped country once extraction and delivery projects are<br/>

  expanded. The Turkmen Government is actively working to diversify<br/>

  its gas export routes beyond the still dominant Russian pipeline<br/>

  network. In 2010, new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to<br/>

  China and to northern Iran began operating, effectively ending the<br/>

  Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports. President for Life<br/>

  Saparmurat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Turkmenistan held its<br/>

  first multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007.<br/>

  Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW,<br/>

  emerged as the country's new president.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86705">Turks and Caicos Islands<br/>

  The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican<br/>

  colony until 1962, when they assumed the status of a separate crown<br/>

  colony upon Jamaica's independence. The governor of The Bahamas<br/>

  oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the<br/>

  islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence<br/>

  was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands<br/>

  remain a British overseas territory.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86706">Tuvalu<br/>

  In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the<br/>

  Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice<br/>

  Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert<br/>

  Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate<br/>

  British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000,<br/>

  Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv"<br/>

  for $50 million in royalties over a 12-year period.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86707">Uganda<br/>

  The colonial boundaries created by Britain to delimit Uganda<br/>

  grouped together a wide range of ethnic groups with different<br/>

  political systems and cultures. These differences prevented the<br/>

  establishment of a working political community after independence<br/>

  was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79)<br/>

  was responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla<br/>

  war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at<br/>

  least another 100,000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986<br/>

  has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. During<br/>

  the 1990s, the government promulgated non-party presidential and<br/>

  legislative elections.<br/>

<p id="id86708" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Ukraine
  Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state,
  Kyivan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest
  and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels
  and Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand
  Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian
  Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid
  the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent
  centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was
  established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against
  the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate
  managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the
  latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic
  territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse
  of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to achieve a short-lived
  period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to
  endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines
  (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II,
  German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million
  more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in
  1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity
  remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic
  corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and
  civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest "Orange Revolution" in the
  closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged
  presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored
  vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor
  YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp
  allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in
  parliamentary elections and become prime minister in August of 2006.
  An early legislative election, brought on by a political crisis in
  the spring of 2007, saw Yuliya TYMOSHENKO, as head of an "Orange"
  coalition, installed as a new prime minister in December 2007.
  Viktor YANUKOVUYCH was elected president in a February 2010 run-off
  election that observers assessed as meeting most international
  standards. The following month, the Rada approved a vote of
  no-confidence prompting Yuliya TYMOSHENKO to resign from her post as
  prime minister.</p>

<p id="id86709">United Arab Emirates<br/>

  The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast<br/>

  granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th<br/>

  century treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman,<br/>

  Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to<br/>

  form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by<br/>

  Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of<br/>

  leading West European nations. Its generosity with oil revenues and<br/>

  its moderate foreign policy stance have allowed the UAE to play a<br/>

  vital role in the affairs of the region. For more than three<br/>

  decades, oil and global finance drove the UAE's economy, however, in<br/>

  2008-09, the confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real<br/>

  estate prices, and the international banking crisis hit the UAE<br/>

  especially hard.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86710">United Kingdom<br/>

  The United Kingdom has historically played a leading<br/>

  role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing<br/>

  literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century, the<br/>

  British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The<br/>

  first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously<br/>

  depleted in two World Wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the<br/>

  union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and<br/>

  the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European<br/>

  nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council,<br/>

  a founding member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a<br/>

  global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member<br/>

  of the EU, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and<br/>

  Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for<br/>

  Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999.<br/>

  The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the<br/>

  peace process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.<br/>

<p id="id86711">United States<br/>

  Britain's American colonies broke with the mother<br/>

  country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United<br/>

  States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the<br/>

  19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13<br/>

  as the nation expanded across the North American continent and<br/>

  acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic<br/>

  experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in<br/>

  which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy<br/>

  of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s,<br/>

  an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force<br/>

  lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the<br/>

  end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most<br/>

  powerful nation state. Over a span of more than five decades, the<br/>

  economy has achieved steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,<br/>

  and rapid advances in technology.<br/>

<p id="id86712" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges
  All of the following
  US Pacific island territories except Midway Atoll constitute the
  Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex and as
  such are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US
  Department of the Interior. Midway Atoll NWR has been included in a
  Refuge Complex with the Hawaiian Islands NWR and also designated as
  part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. These remote
  refuges are the most widespread collection of marine- and
  terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single
  country's jurisdiction. They sustain many endemic species including
  corals, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds, water birds, land
  birds, insects, and vegetation not found elsewhere.
  Baker Island: The US took possession of the island in 1857. Its
  guano deposits were mined by US and British companies during the
  second half of the 19th century. In 1935, a short-lived attempt at
  colonization began on this island but was disrupted by World War II
  and thereafter abandoned. The island was established as a NWR in
  1974.
  Howland Island: Discovered by the US early in the 19th century, the
  uninhabited atoll was officially claimed by the US in 1857. Both US
  and British companies mined for guano deposits until about 1890. In
  1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization began on this island,
  similar to the effort on nearby Baker Island, but was disrupted by
  World War II and thereafter abandoned. The famed American aviatrix
  Amelia EARHART disappeared while seeking out Howland Island as a
  refueling stop during her 1937 round-the-world flight; Earhart
  Light, a day beacon near the middle of the west coast, was named in
  her memory. The island was established as a NWR in 1974.
  Jarvis Island: First discovered by the British in 1821, the
  uninhabited island was annexed by the US in 1858 but abandoned in
  1879 after tons of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island
  in 1889 but never carried out plans for further exploitation. The US
  occupied and reclaimed the island in 1935. It was abandoned in 1942
  during World War II. The island was established as a NWR in 1974.
  Johnston Atoll: Both the US and the Kingdom of Hawaii annexed
  Johnston Atoll in 1858, but it was the US that mined the guano
  deposits until the late 1880s. Johnston and Sand Islands were
  designated wildlife refuges in 1926. The US Navy took over the atoll
  in 1934. Subsequently, the US Air Force assumed control in 1948. The
  site was used for high-altitude nuclear tests in the 1950s and
  1960s. Until late in 2000 the atoll was maintained as a storage and
  disposal site for chemical weapons. Munitions destruction, cleanup,
  and closure of the facility were completed by May 2005. The Fish and
  Wildlife Service and the US Air Force are currently discussing
  future management options; in the interim, Johnston Atoll and the
  three-mile Naval Defensive Sea around it remain under the
  jurisdiction and administrative control of the US Air Force.
  Kingman Reef: The US annexed the reef in 1922. Its sheltered lagoon
  served as a way station for flying boats on Hawaii-to-American Samoa
  flights during the late 1930s. There are no terrestrial plants on
  the reef, which is frequently awash, but it does support abundant
  and diverse marine fauna and flora. In 2001, the waters surrounding
  the reef out to 12 nm were designated a US NWR.
  Midway Islands: The US took formal possession of the islands in
  1867. The laying of the trans-Pacific cable, which passed through
  the islands, brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and
  1947, Midway was used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights.
  The US naval victory over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was
  one of the turning points of World War II. The islands continued to
  serve as a naval station until closed in 1993. Today the islands are
  a NWR and are the site of the world's largest Laysan albatross
  colony.
  Palmyra Atoll: The Kingdom of Hawaii claimed the atoll in 1862, and
  the US included it among the Hawaiian Islands when it annexed the
  archipelago in 1898. The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 did not
  include Palmyra Atoll, which is now partly privately owned by the
  Nature Conservancy with the rest owned by the Federal government and
  managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. These organizations are
  managing the atoll as a wildlife refuge. The lagoons and surrounding
  waters within the 12 nm US territorial seas were transferred to the
  US Fish and Wildlife Service and designated as a NWR in January 2001.</p>

<p id="id86713">Uruguay<br/>

  Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military<br/>

  stronghold, soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an<br/>

  important commercial center. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by<br/>

  Brazil in 1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later<br/>

  and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The<br/>

  administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century<br/>

  established widespread political, social, and economic reforms that<br/>

  established a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla<br/>

  movement named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led<br/>

  Uruguay's president to cede control of the government to the<br/>

  military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the<br/>

  military continued to expand its hold over the government. Civilian<br/>

  rule was not restored until 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center Frente<br/>

  Amplio Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170<br/>

  years of political control previously held by the Colorado and<br/>

  Blanco parties. Uruguay's political and labor conditions are among<br/>

  the freest on the continent.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86714">Uzbekistan<br/>

  Russia conquered the territory of present-day Uzbekistan<br/>

  in the late 19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the<br/>

  Boshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist<br/>

  republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive<br/>

  production of "white gold" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of<br/>

  agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have left<br/>

  the land poisoned and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry.<br/>

  Independent since 1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its<br/>

  dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum<br/>

  reserves. Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militants,<br/>

  economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and<br/>

  democratization.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86715">Vanuatu<br/>

  Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct<br/>

  language, migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding<br/>

  European exploration in the 18th century. This settlement pattern<br/>

  accounts for the complex linguistic diversity found on the<br/>

  archipelago to this day. The British and French, who settled the New<br/>

  Hebrides in the 19th century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French<br/>

  Condominium, which administered the islands until independence in<br/>

  1980, when the new name of Vanuatu was adopted.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86716">Venezuela<br/>

  Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the<br/>

  collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New<br/>

  Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the<br/>

  20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military<br/>

  strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social<br/>

  reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since<br/>

  1959. Hugo CHAVEZ, president since 1999, seeks to implement his<br/>

  "21st Century Socialism," which purports to alleviate social ills<br/>

  while at the same time attacking capitalist globalization and<br/>

  existing democratic institutions. Current concerns include: a<br/>

  weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a<br/>

  politicized military, drug-related violence along the Colombian<br/>

  border, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price<br/>

  fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are<br/>

  endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86717">Vietnam<br/>

  The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was<br/>

  completed by 1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887.<br/>

  Vietnam declared independence after World War II, but France<br/>

  continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by Communist forces under Ho<br/>

  Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into<br/>

  the Communist North and anti-Communist South. US economic and<br/>

  military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt<br/>

  to bolster the government, but US armed forces were withdrawn<br/>

  following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North<br/>

  Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under<br/>

  Communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the<br/>

  country experienced little economic growth because of conservative<br/>

  leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals<br/>

  - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing<br/>

  international isolation. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's<br/>

  "doi moi" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have<br/>

  committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted<br/>

  structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce<br/>

  more competitive, export-driven industries. The Communist leaders,<br/>

  however, maintain control on political expression and have resisted<br/>

  outside calls to improve human rights. The country continues to<br/>

  experience small-scale protests from various groups, the vast<br/>

  majority connected to land-use issues, calls for increased political<br/>

  space and the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes.<br/>

  Various ethnic minorities, such as the Montagnards of the Central<br/>

  Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region, have also<br/>

  held protests.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86718">Virgin Islands
  During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided
  into two territorial units, one English and the other Danish.
  Sugarcane, produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy
  during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1917, the US purchased
  the Danish portion, which had been in economic decline since the
  abolition of slavery in 1848.</p>

<p id="id86719">Wake Island<br/>

  The US annexed Wake Island in 1899 for a cable station.<br/>

  An important air and naval base was constructed in 1940-41. In<br/>

  December 1941, the island was captured by the Japanese and held<br/>

  until the end of World War II. In subsequent years, Wake was<br/>

  developed as a stopover and refueling site for military and<br/>

  commercial aircraft transiting the Pacific. Since 1974, the island's<br/>

  airstrip has been used by the US military, as well as for emergency<br/>

  landings. Although operations on the island were suspended and all<br/>

  personnel evacuated in August 2006 with the approach of super<br/>

  typhoon IOKE (category 5), damage was comparatively minor. A US Air<br/>

  Force repair team restored full capability to the airfield and<br/>

  facilities, which remains a vital strategic link in the Pacific<br/>

  region.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86720">Wallis and Futuna<br/>

  The Futuna island group was discovered by the<br/>

  Dutch in 1616 and Wallis by the British in 1767, but it was the<br/>

  French who declared a protectorate over the islands in 1842. In<br/>

  1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a French<br/>

  overseas territory.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86721">West Bank<br/>

  The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on<br/>

  Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional<br/>

  period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<br/>

  Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September<br/>

  1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security<br/>

  and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of<br/>

  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the<br/>

  permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following<br/>

  the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the<br/>

  Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final<br/>

  settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the<br/>

  two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic<br/>

  Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late<br/>

  2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month<br/>

  later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments<br/>

  in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005,<br/>

  Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and<br/>

  dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew<br/>

  settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank<br/>

  settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace,<br/>

  and most access to the Gaza Strip. In January 2006, the Islamic<br/>

  Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian<br/>

  Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government<br/>

  in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating<br/>

  with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the<br/>

  international community so as to lift economic sanctions on<br/>

  Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in<br/>

  the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous<br/>

  Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS<br/>

  Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi<br/>

  Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National<br/>

  Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA.<br/>

  However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007,<br/>

  HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and<br/>

  governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG<br/>

  and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government<br/>

  in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the<br/>

  NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered<br/>

  reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge<br/>

  their differences. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of<br/>

  the Gaza Strip and ABBAS and the Fatah-dominated PA governing the<br/>

  West Bank. FAYYAD and his PA government continue to implement a<br/>

  series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the<br/>

  West Bank. ABBAS has said he will not resume negotiations with<br/>

  current Prime Minister NETANYAHU until Israel halts all settlement<br/>

  activity in the West Bank and Jerusalem.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86722">Western Sahara<br/>

  Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western<br/>

  Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the<br/>

  territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla<br/>

  war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco's sovereignty ended<br/>

  in a 1991 UN-brokered cease-fire; a UN-organized referendum on the<br/>

  territory's final status has been repeatedly postponed. The UN since<br/>

  2007 has sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the<br/>

  Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to negotiate the<br/>

  status of Western Sahara. Morocco has put forward an autonomy<br/>

  proposal for the territory, which would allow for some local<br/>

  administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty. The<br/>

  Polisario, with Algeria's support, demands a popular referendum that<br/>

  includes the option of independence.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86723">World<br/>

  Globally, the 20th century was marked by: (a) two devastating<br/>

  world wars; (b) the Great Depression of the 1930s; (c) the end of<br/>

  vast colonial empires; (d) rapid advances in science and technology,<br/>

  from the first airplane flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (US) to<br/>

  the landing on the moon; (e) the Cold War between the Western<br/>

  alliance and the Warsaw Pact nations; (f) a sharp rise in living<br/>

  standards in North America, Europe, and Japan; (g) increased<br/>

  concerns about the environment, including loss of forests, shortages<br/>

  of energy and water, the decline in biological diversity, and air<br/>

  pollution; (h) the onset of the AIDS epidemic; and (i) the ultimate<br/>

  emergence of the US as the only world superpower. The planet's<br/>

  population continues to explode: from 1 billion in 1820, to 2<br/>

  billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion in<br/>

  1988, and 6 billion in 2000. For the 21st century, the continued<br/>

  exponential growth in science and technology raises both hopes<br/>

  (e.g., advances in medicine) and fears (e.g., development of even<br/>

  more lethal weapons of war).<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86724">Yemen<br/>

  North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918.<br/>

  The British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern<br/>

  port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became<br/>

  South Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a<br/>

  Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of<br/>

  Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of<br/>

  hostility between the states. The two countries were formally<br/>

  unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist<br/>

  movement in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and<br/>

  Yemen agreed to a delimitation of their border.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86725">Zambia<br/>

  The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the<br/>

  [British] South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by<br/>

  the UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining<br/>

  spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia<br/>

  upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper<br/>

  prices and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991<br/>

  brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996<br/>

  saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001<br/>

  was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a<br/>

  legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate<br/>

  Levy MWANAWASA. The new president launched an anticorruption<br/>

  investigation in 2002 to probe high-level corruption during the<br/>

  previous administration. In 2006-07, this task force successfully<br/>

  prosecuted four cases, including a landmark civil case in the UK in<br/>

  which former President CHILUBA and numerous others were found liable<br/>

  for USD 41 million. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election<br/>

  that was deemed free and fair. Upon his abrupt death in August 2008,<br/>

  he was succeeded by his Vice President Rupiah BANDA, who<br/>

  subsequently won a special presidential election in October 2008.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id86726" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Zimbabwe
  The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South
  Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that
  favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally
  declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and
  demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority
  in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla
  uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as
  Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister,
  has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has
  dominated the country's political system since independence. His
  chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an
  exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in
  widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international
  condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure
  his reelection. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation
  to win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary
  election, allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate
  the Senate, which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April
  2005, Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an
  urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of
  the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the
  opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls
  on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store
  shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008
  contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the
  ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of
  seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the
  most votes in the presidential polls, but not enough to win
  outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008,
  considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led
  to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence
  of vote tampering and ballot-box stuffing resulted in international
  condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a
  power-sharing government, in which MUGABE remained president and
  TSVANGIRAI became prime minister, were finally settled in February
  2009, although the leaders have yet failed to agree upon many key
  outstanding governmental issues.</p>
