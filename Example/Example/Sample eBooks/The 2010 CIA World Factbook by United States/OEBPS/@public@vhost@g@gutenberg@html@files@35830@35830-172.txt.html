  and the South Sandwich Islands in its constitution, forcibly<br/>

  occupying the Falklands in 1982, but in 1995 agreed no longer to<br/>

  seek settlement by force; territorial claim in Antarctica partially<br/>

  overlaps UK and Chilean claims; unruly region at convergence of<br/>

  Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders is locus of money laundering,<br/>

  smuggling, arms and illegal narcotics trafficking, and fundraising<br/>

  for extremist organizations; uncontested dispute between Brazil and<br/>

  Uruguay over Braziliera/Brasiliera Island in the Quarai/Cuareim<br/>

  River leaves the tripoint with Argentina in question; in 2006,<br/>

  Argentina went to the ICJ to protest, on environmental grounds, the<br/>

  construction of two pulp mills in Uruguay on the Uruguay River,<br/>

  which forms the boundary; both parties presented their pleadings in<br/>

  2007 with Argentina's reply in January and Uruguay's rejoinder in<br/>

  July 2008; the joint boundary commission, established by Chile and<br/>

  million square kilometers, expanding its seabed roughly 30 percent<br/>

  more than its claimed exclusive economic zone; since 2003, Australia<br/>

  the ICJ has given Costa Rica until January 2008 to reply<br/>

  and Nicaragua until July 2008 to rejoin before rendering its<br/>

  Rican vessels on the Rio San Juan over which Nicaragua retains<br/>

  sovereignty<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92832">Cote d'Ivoire<br/>

  despite the presence of over 9,000 UN forces (UNOCI)<br/>

  in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict still leaves displaced<br/>

  hundreds of thousands of Ivorians in and out of the country as well<br/>

  as driven out migrants from neighboring states who worked in Ivorian<br/>

  cocoa plantations; the March 2007 peace deal between Ivorian rebels<br/>

  and the government brought significant numbers of rebels out of<br/>

  hiding in neighboring states<br/>

<p id="id92833">Croatia<br/>

  dispute remains with Bosnia and Herzegovina over several<br/>

  small sections of the boundary related to maritime access that<br/>

  hinders ratification of the 1999 border agreement; the<br/>

  Croatia-Slovenia land and maritime boundary agreement, which would<br/>

  have ceded most of Pirin Bay and maritime access to Slovenia and<br/>

  several villages to Croatia, remains unratified and in dispute;<br/>

  Slovenia also protests Croatia's 2003 claim to an exclusive economic<br/>

  zone in the Adriatic; as a European Union peripheral state, Slovenia<br/>

  imposed a hard border Schengen regime with non-member Croatia in<br/>

  December 2007<br/>

<p id="id92835">Cyprus<br/>

  hostilities in 1974 divided the island into two de facto<br/>

  autonomous entities, the internationally recognized Cypriot<br/>

  Government and a Turkish-Cypriot community (north Cyprus); the<br/>

  1,000-strong UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has served in<br/>

  Cyprus since 1964 and maintains the buffer zone between north and<br/>

  south; on 1 May 2004, Cyprus entered the European Union still<br/>

  divided, with the EU's body of legislation and standards (acquis<br/>

  communitaire) suspended in the north; Turkey protests Cypriot<br/>

  Government creating hydrocarbon blocks and maritime boundary with<br/>

  Lebanon in March 2007<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92836">Czech Republic<br/>

  while threats of international legal action never<br/>

  materialized in 2007, 915,220 Austrians, with the support of the<br/>

  popular Freedom Party, signed a petition in January 2008, demanding<br/>

  that Austria block the Czech Republic's accession to the EU unless<br/>

  Prague closes its controversial Soviet-style nuclear plant in<br/>

  Temelin, bordering Austria<br/>

<p id="id92837">Denmark<br/>

  Iceland, the UK, and Ireland dispute Denmark's claim that<br/>

  the Faroe Islands' continental shelf extends beyond 200 nm; Faroese<br/>

  dispute with Canada over Hans Island in the Kennedy Channel between<br/>

  Ellesmere Island and Greenland<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92838">Djibouti<br/>

  Djibouti maintains economic ties and border accords with<br/>

  "Somaliland" leadership while maintaining some political ties to<br/>

  various factions in Somalia; Kuwait is chief investor in the 2008<br/>

  restoration and upgrade of the Ethiopian-Djibouti rail link; in<br/>

  2008, Eritrean troops move across the border on Ras Doumera<br/>

  peninsula and occupy Doumera Island with undefined sovereignty in<br/>

  the Red Sea<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92839">Dominica<br/>

  Dominica is the only Caribbean state to challenge<br/>

  Venezuela's sovereignty claim over Aves Island and joins the other<br/>

  island nations in challenging whether the feature sustains human<br/>

  habitation, a criterion under the UN Convention on the Law of the<br/>

  Sea (UNCLOS), which permits Venezuela to extend its Exclusive<br/>

  Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf claims over a large<br/>

  portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea<br/>

  Sudan claims but Egypt de facto administers security and<br/>

  economic development of Halaib region north of the 22nd parallel<br/>

  boundary; Egypt no longer shows its administration of the Bir Tawil<br/>

  trapezoid in Sudan on its maps; Gazan breaches in the security wall<br/>

  with Egypt in January 2008 highlight difficulties in monitoring the<br/>

  Sinai border; Saudi Arabia claims Egyptian-administered islands of<br/>

  Tiran and Sanafir<br/>

<p id="id92843">El Salvador<br/>

  International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on the<br/>

  delimitation of "bolsones" (disputed areas) along the El<br/>

  Salvador-Honduras boundary, in 1992, with final agreement by the<br/>

  parties in 2006 after an Organization of American States (OAS)<br/>

  survey and a further ICJ ruling in 2003; the 1992 ICJ ruling advised<br/>

  a tripartite resolution to a maritime boundary in the Gulf of<br/>

  Fonseca advocating Honduran access to the Pacific; El Salvador<br/>

  continues to claim tiny Conejo Island, not identified in the ICJ<br/>

  decision, off Honduras in the Gulf of Fonseca<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92844">Equatorial Guinea<br/>

  in 2002, ICJ ruled on an equidistance settlement<br/>

  of Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf<br/>

  of Guinea, but a dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over<br/>

  an island at the mouth of the Ntem River and imprecisely defined<br/>

  maritime coordinates in the ICJ decision delay final delimitation;<br/>

  UN urges Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to resolve the sovereignty<br/>

  dispute over Gabon-occupied Mbane and lesser islands and to create a<br/>

  maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Corisco Bay<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92845">Eritrea<br/>

  Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by 2002<br/>

  Ethiopia-Eritrea Boundary Commission's (EEBC) delimitation decision<br/>

  but, neither party responded to the revised line detailed in the<br/>

  November 2006 EEBC Demarcation Statement; Sudan accuses Eritrea of<br/>

  supporting eastern Sudanese rebel groups; in 2008 Eritrean troops<br/>

  move across the border on Ras Doumera peninsula and occupy Doumera<br/>

  Island with undefined sovereignty in the Red Sea<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92846">Estonia<br/>

  Russia recalled its signature to the 1996 technical border<br/>

  agreement with Estonia in 2005, rather than concede to Estonia's<br/>

  appending prepared a unilateral declaration referencing Soviet<br/>

  occupation and territorial losses; Russia demands better<br/>

  accommodation of Russian-speaking population in Estonia; Estonian<br/>

  citizen groups continue to press for realignment of the boundary<br/>

  based on the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the now<br/>

  divided ethnic Setu people and parts of the Narva region within<br/>

  Estonia; as a member state that forms part of the EU's external<br/>

  border, Estonia must implement the strict Schengen border rules with<br/>

  Russia<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92847">Ethiopia<br/>

  Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by the 2002<br/>

  Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission's (EEBC) delimitation decision,<br/>

  but neither party responded to the revised line detailed in the<br/>

  November 2006 EEBC Demarcation Statement; the undemarcated former<br/>

  British administrative line has little meaning as a political<br/>

  separation to rival clans within Ethiopia's Ogaden and southern<br/>

  Somalia's Oromo region; Ethiopian forces invaded southern Somalia<br/>

  and routed Islamist Courts from Mogadishu in January 2007;<br/>

  "Somaliland" secessionists provide port facilities in Berbera and<br/>

  trade ties to landlocked Ethiopia; civil unrest in eastern Sudan has<br/>

  hampered efforts to demarcate the porous boundary with Ethiopia<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92848">European Union<br/>

  as a political union, the EU has no border disputes<br/>

  with neighboring countries, but Estonia has no land boundary<br/>

  agreements with Russia, Slovenia disputes its land and maritime<br/>

  boundaries with Croatia, and Spain has territorial and maritime<br/>

  disputes with Morocco and with the UK over Gibraltar; the EU has set<br/>

  up a Schengen area - consisting of 22 EU member states that have<br/>

  signed the convention implementing the Schengen agreements or<br/>

  "acquis" (1985 and 1990) on the free movement of persons and the<br/>

  harmonization of border controls in Europe; these agreements became<br/>

  incorporated into EU law with the implementation of the 1997 Treaty<br/>

  of Amsterdam on 1 May 1999; in addition, non-EU states Iceland and<br/>

  Norway (as part of the Nordic Union) have been included in the<br/>

  Schengen area since 1996 (full members in 2001), and Switzerland<br/>

  since 2008 bringing the total current membership to 25; the UK<br/>

  (since 2000) and Ireland (since 2002) take part in only some aspects<br/>

  of the Schengen area, especially with respect to police and criminal<br/>

  matters; nine of the 12 new member states that joined the EU since<br/>

  2004 joined Schengen on 21 December 2007; of the three remaining EU<br/>

  states, Cyprus is expected to join by 2009, while Romania and<br/>

  Bulgaria continue to enhance their border security systems<br/>

<p id="id92849">Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)<br/>

  Argentina, which claims the<br/>

  islands in its constitution and briefly occupied them by force in<br/>

  1982, agreed in 1995 to no longer seek settlement by force; UK<br/>

  continues to reject Argentine requests for sovereignty talks<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92850">Faroe Islands<br/>

  because anticipated offshore hydrocarbon resources<br/>

  have not been realized, earlier Faroese proposals for full<br/>

  the sovereignty dispute over the islands of Etorofu,<br/>

  Kunashiri, and Shikotan, and the Habomai group, known in Japan as<br/>

  the "Northern Territories" and in Russia as the "Southern Kuril<br/>

  Islands," occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945, now administered by<br/>

  Russia and claimed by Japan, remains the primary sticking point to<br/>

  signing a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities;<br/>

  Japan and South Korea claim Liancourt Rocks (Take-shima/Tok-do)<br/>

  occupied by South Korea since 1954; China and Taiwan dispute both<br/>

  Japan's claims to the uninhabited islands of the Senkaku-shoto<br/>

  (Diaoyu Tai) and Japan's unilaterally declared exclusive economic<br/>

  zone in the East China Sea, the site of intensive hydrocarbon<br/>

  prospecting<br/>

<p id="id92892">Jordan<br/>

  approximately two million Iraqis have fled the conflict in<br/>

  Iraq, with the majority taking refuge in Syria and Jordan; 2004<br/>

  Agreement settles border dispute with Syria pending demarcation<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92893">Kazakhstan<br/>

  Kyrgyzstan has yet to ratify the 2001 boundary<br/>

  delimitation with Kazakhstan; field demarcation of the boundaries<br/>

  with Turkmenistan commenced in 2005, and with Uzbekistan in 2004;<br/>

  demarcation is scheduled to get underway with Russia in 2007;<br/>

  demarcation with China was completed in 2002; creation of a seabed<br/>

  boundary with Turkmenistan in the Caspian Sea remains under<br/>

  discussion; equidistant seabed treaties have been ratified with<br/>

  Azerbaijan and Russia in the Caspian Sea, but no resolution has been<br/>

  made on dividing the water column among any of the littoral states<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92894">Kenya<br/>

  Kenya served as an important mediator in brokering Sudan's<br/>

  north-south separation in February 2005; Kenya provides shelter to<br/>

  almost a quarter of a million refugees, including Ugandans who flee<br/>

  across the border periodically to seek protection from Lord's<br/>

  Resistance Army (LRA) rebels; Kenya works hard to prevent the clan<br/>

  and militia fighting in Somalia from spreading across the border,<br/>

  which has long been open to nomadic pastoralists; the boundary that<br/>

  separates Kenya's and Sudan's sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi<br/>

  Triangle," which Kenya has administered since colonial times<br/>

<p id="id92896">Korea, North<br/>

  risking arrest, imprisonment, and deportation, tens of<br/>

  thousands of North Koreans cross into China to escape famine,<br/>

  economic privation, and political oppression; North Korea and China<br/>

  dispute the sovereignty of certain islands in Yalu and Tumen rivers;<br/>

  Military Demarcation Line within the 4-km wide Demilitarized Zone<br/>

  has separated North from South Korea since 1953; periodic incidents<br/>

  in the Yellow Sea with South Korea which claims the Northern<br/>

  Limiting Line as a maritime boundary; North Korea supports South<br/>

  Korea in rejecting Japan's claim to Liancourt Rocks<br/>

  (Tok-do/Take-shima)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92897">Korea, South<br/>

  Military Demarcation Line within the 4-km wide<br/>

  Demilitarized Zone has separated North from South Korea since 1953;<br/>

  periodic incidents with North Korea in the Yellow Sea over the<br/>

  Northern Limit Line, which South Korea claims as a maritime<br/>

  boundary; South Korea and Japan claim Liancourt Rocks<br/>

  (Tok-do/Take-shima), occupied by South Korea since 1954<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92898">Kosovo<br/>

  Serbia with several other states protest the US and other<br/>

  states' recognition of Kosovo's declaring itself as a sovereign and<br/>

  independent state in February 2008; ethnic Serbian municipalities<br/>

  along Kosovo's northern border challenge final status of<br/>

  Kosovo-Serbia boundary; several thousand NATO-led KFOR peacekeepers<br/>

  under UNMIK authority continue to keep the peace within Kosovo<br/>

  between the ethnic Albanian majority and the Serb minority in<br/>

  Kosovo; Kosovo and Macedonia completed demarcation of their boundary<br/>

  in September 2008<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92899">Kuwait<br/>

  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continue negotiating a joint maritime<br/>

  boundary with Iran; no maritime boundary exists with Iraq in the<br/>

  Persian Gulf<br/>

<p id="id92900">Kyrgyzstan<br/>

  Kyrgyzstan has yet to ratify the 2001 boundary<br/>

  delimitation with Kazakhstan; disputes in Isfara Valley delay<br/>

  completion of delimitation with Tajikistan; delimitation of 130 km<br/>

  of border with Uzbekistan is hampered by serious disputes around<br/>

  enclaves and other areas<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92901">Laos<br/>

  Southeast Asian states have enhanced border surveillance to<br/>

  check the spread of avian flu; talks continue on completion of<br/>

  demarcation with Thailand but disputes remain over islands in the<br/>

  Mekong River; concern among Mekong Commission members that China's<br/>

  construction of dams on the Mekong River will affect water levels<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92902">Latvia<br/>

  Russia demands better Latvian treatment of ethnic Russians in<br/>

  Latvia; as of January 2007, ground demarcation of the boundary with<br/>

  Belarus was complete and mapped with final ratification<br/>

  documentation in preparation; the Latvian parliament has not<br/>

  ratified its 1998 maritime boundary treaty with Lithuania, primarily<br/>

  due to concerns over oil exploration rights; as a member state that<br/>

  forms part of the EU's external border, Latvia has implemented the<br/>

  strict Schengen border rules with Russia<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92903">Lebanon<br/>

  lacking a treaty or other documentation describing the<br/>

  boundary, portions of the Lebanon-Syria boundary are unclear with<br/>

  several sections in dispute; since 2000, Lebanon has claimed Shab'a<br/>

  Farms area in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights; the roughly<br/>

  2,000-strong UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been in place<br/>

  since 1978<br/>

<p id="id92905">Liberia<br/>

  although civil unrest continues to abate with the assistance<br/>

  of 18,000 UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) peacekeepers, as of January<br/>

  2007, Liberian refugees still remain in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire,<br/>

  Sierra Leone, and Ghana; Liberia, in turn, shelters refugees fleeing<br/>

  turmoil in Cote d'Ivoire; despite the presence of over 9,000 UN<br/>

  forces (UNOCI) in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict<br/>

  continues to spread into neighboring states who can no longer send<br/>

  their migrant workers to Ivorian cocoa plantations; UN sanctions ban<br/>

  Liberia from exporting diamonds and timber<br/>
</p>

<p id="id92906">Libya<br/>

  Libya has claimed more than 32,000 sq km in southeastern<br/>

  Algeria and about 25,000 sq km in the Tommo region of Niger in a<br/>

  currently dormant dispute; various Chadian rebels from the Aozou<br/>

  region reside in southern Libya<br/>

<p id="id92908">Lithuania<br/>

  Lithuania and Russia committed to demarcating their<br/>

  boundary in 2006 in accordance with the land and maritime treaty<br/>

  ratified by Russia in May 2003 and by Lithuania in 1999; Lithuania<br/>

  operates a simplified transit regime for Russian nationals traveling<br/>

  from the Kaliningrad coastal exclave into Russia, while still<br/>

  conforming, as a EU member state having an external border with a<br/>

  non-EU member, to strict Schengen border rules; the Latvian<br/>

  parliament has not ratified its 1998 maritime boundary treaty with<br/>

  Lithuania, primarily due to concerns over potential hydrocarbons; as<br/>

  of January 2007, ground demarcation of the boundary with Belarus was<br/>

  complete and mapped with final ratification documents in preparation<br/>

  drying cays of Banc du Geyser, which were claimed by Madagascar in<br/>

  1976, also fall within the EEZ claims of the Comoros and France<br/>

  (Glorioso Islands, part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands)<br/>

  disputes with Tanzania over the boundary in Lake Nyasa (Lake<br/>

  Malawi) and the meandering Songwe River remain dormant<br/>

<p id="id92914">Malaysia<br/>

  Malaysia is involved in a complex dispute with Brunei,<br/>

  China, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam over claims to part or all<br/>

  of the Spratly Islands; while the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct<br/>

  of Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions over the<br/>

  Spratly Islands, it is not the legally binding "code of conduct"<br/>

  sought by some parties; Malaysia was not party to the March 2005<br/>

  joint accord among the national oil companies of China, the<br/>

  Philippines, and Vietnam on conducting marine seismic activities in<br/>

  the Spratly Islands; disputes continue over deliveries of fresh<br/>

  water to Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation, bridge<br/>

  construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore<br/>

  Straits; in 2008, ICJ awards sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu<br/>

  Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia,<br/>

  but does not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of<br/>

  South Ledge; ICJ awarded Ligitan and Sipadan islands, also claimed<br/>

  by Indonesia and Philippines, to Malaysia but left maritime boundary<br/>

  and sovereignty of Unarang rock in the hydrocarbon-rich Celebes Sea<br/>

  in dispute; separatist violence in Thailand's predominantly Muslim<br/>

  southern provinces prompts measures to close and monitor border with<br/>

  Malaysia to stem terrorist activities; Philippines retains a dormant<br/>

  claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo; Brunei and<br/>

  Malaysia agreed in September 2008 to resolve their offshore and<br/>

  deepwater seabed dispute, resume hydrocarbon exploration, and<br/>

  renounce any territorial claims along their land boundary; piracy<br/>

  remains a problem in the Malacca Strait<br/>
