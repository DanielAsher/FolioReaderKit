  since 1949; India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic<br/>

  Kashmir lands to China in 1964; India and Pakistan have maintained<br/>

  China and Russia have demarcated the once disputed islands at
  the Amur and Ussuri confluence and in the Argun River in accordance
  with the 2004 Agreement, ending their centuries-long border
  disputes; the sovereignty dispute over the islands of Etorofu,
  Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai group, known in Japan as the
  "Northern Territories" and in Russia as the "Southern Kurils,"
  occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945, now administered by Russia,
  and claimed by Japan, remains the primary sticking point to signing
  a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities; Russia and
  Georgia agree on delimiting all but small, strategic segments of the
  land boundary and the maritime boundary; OSCE observers monitor
  volatile areas such as the Pankisi Gorge in the Akhmeti region and
  the Kodori Gorge in Abkhazia; Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia
  signed equidistance boundaries in the Caspian seabed but the
  littoral states have no consensus on dividing the water column;
  Russia and Norway reached an agreement on how to align Barents Sea
  and Arctic Ocean boundaries over EEZ and continental shelf in an
  agreement signed on 15 September 2010; this agreement is pending
  ratification by the respective national assemblies; various groups
  in Finland advocate restoration of Karelia (Kareliya) and other
  areas ceded to the Soviet Union following the Second World War but
  the Finnish Government asserts no territorial demands; in May 2005,
  Russia recalled its signatures to the 1996 border agreements with
  Estonia (1996) and Latvia (1997), when the two Baltic states
  announced issuance of unilateral declarations referencing Soviet
  occupation and ensuing territorial losses; Russia demands better
  treatment of ethnic Russians in Estonia and Latvia; Estonian citizen
  groups continue to press for realignment of the boundary based on
  the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the now divided ethnic
  Setu people and parts of the Narva region within Estonia; Lithuania
  and Russia committed to demarcating their boundary in 2006 in
  accordance with the land and maritime treaty ratified by Russia in
  May 2003 and by Lithuania in 1999; Lithuania operates a simplified
  transit regime for Russian nationals traveling from the Kaliningrad
  coastal exclave into Russia, while still conforming, as an EU member
  state with an EU external border, where strict Schengen border rules
  apply; preparations for the demarcation delimitation of land
  boundary with Ukraine have commenced; the dispute over the boundary
  between Russia and Ukraine through the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov
  remains unresolved despite a December 2003 framework agreement and
  on-going expert-level discussions; Kazakhstan and Russia boundary

  numbers of Ethiopians, Ugandans, Central Africans, and Congolese as<br/>

  refugees; in February 2006, Sudan and DROC signed an agreement to<br/>

  repatriate 13,300 Sudanese and 6,800 Congolese; Sudan accuses<br/>

  Eritrea of supporting Sudanese rebel groups; efforts to demarcate<br/>

  the porous boundary with Ethiopia proceed slowly due to civil and<br/>

  ethnic fighting in eastern Sudan; the boundary that separates Kenya<br/>

  and Sudan's sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi Triangle," which<br/>

  since 1964; lacking a treaty or other documentation describing the<br/>

  boundary, portions of the Lebanon-Syria boundary are unclear with<br/>

  several sections in dispute; since 2000, Lebanon has claimed Shab'a<br/>

  Farms in the Golan Heights; 2004 Agreement and pending demarcation<br/>

  the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions<br/>

  but falls short of a legally binding "code of conduct" desired by<br/>

  several of the disputants; Paracel Islands are occupied by China,<br/>

  but claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam; in 2003, China and Taiwan became<br/>

  more vocal in rejecting both Japan's claims to the uninhabited<br/>

  on completion of demarcation with Laos but disputes remain over<br/>

  several islands in the Mekong River; despite continuing border<br/>

  committee talks, Thailand must deal with Karen and other ethnic<br/>

  rebels, refugees, and illegal cross-border activities, and as of<br/>

  2006, over 116,000 Karen, Hmong, and other refugees and asylum<br/>

  seekers from Burma; Cambodia and Thailand dispute sections of<br/>

  historic boundary with missing boundary markers; Cambodia claims<br/>

  Thai encroachments into Cambodian territory and obstructing access<br/>

  to Preah Vihear temple ruins awarded to Cambodia by ICJ decision in<br/>

  1962; Thailand is studying the feasibility of jointly constructing<br/>

  the Hatgyi Dam on the Salween river near the border with Burma; in<br/>

  2004, international environmentalist pressure prompted China to halt<br/>

  construction of 13 dams on the Salween River that flows through<br/>

  maritime boundaries with Indonesia remain unresolved; many refugees<br/>

  who left Timor-Leste in 2003 still reside in Indonesia and refuse<br/>

  stretching over 250,000 km, the world's 322 international land
  boundaries separate 194 independent states and 71 dependencies,
  areas of special sovereignty, and other miscellaneous entities;
  ethnicity, culture, race, religion, and language have divided states
  into separate political entities as much as history, physical
  terrain, political fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes
  arbitrary and imposed boundaries; most maritime states have claimed
  limits that include territorial seas and exclusive economic zones;
  overlapping limits due to adjacent or opposite coasts create the
  potential for 430 bilateral maritime boundaries of which 209 have
  agreements that include contiguous and non-contiguous segments;
  boundary, borderland/resource, and territorial disputes vary in
  intensity from managed or dormant to violent or militarized;
  undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and unmanaged boundaries tend to
  encourage illegal cross-border activities, uncontrolled migration,
  and confrontation; territorial disputes may evolve from historical
  and/or cultural claims, or they may be brought on by resource
  competition; ethnic and cultural clashes continue to be responsible
  for much of the territorial fragmentation and internal displacement
  of the estimated 6.6 million people and cross-border displacements
  of 8.6 million refugees around the world as of early 2006; just over
  one million refugees were repatriated in the same period; other
  sources of contention include access to water and mineral
  (especially hydrocarbon) resources, fisheries, and arable land;
  armed conflict prevails not so much between the uniformed armed
  forces of independent states as between stateless armed entities
  that detract from the sustenance and welfare of local populations,
