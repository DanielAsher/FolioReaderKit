<p id="id94241" style="margin-top: 2em">  Flag description</p>

<p id="id94242">Afghanistan<br/>

  three equal vertical bands of black (hoist side), red,<br/>

  and green, with the national emblem in white centered on the red<br/>

  band and slightly overlapping the other two bands; the center of the<br/>

  emblem features a mosque with pulpit and flags on either side, below<br/>

  the mosque are numerals for the solar year 1298 (1919 in the<br/>

  Gregorian calendar, the year of Afghan independence from the UK);<br/>

  this central image is circled by a border consisting of sheaves of<br/>

  wheat on the left and right, in the upper-center is an Arabic<br/>

  inscription of the Shahada (Muslim creed) below which are rays of<br/>

  the rising sun over the Takbir (Arabic expression meaning "God is<br/>

  great"), and at bottom center is a scroll bearing the name<br/>

  Afghanistan; black signifies the past, red is for the blood shed for<br/>

  independence, and green can represent either hope for the future,<br/>

  agricultural prosperity, or Islam<br/>

  note: Afghanistan had more changes to its national flag in the 20th<br/>

  century than any other country; the colors black, red, and green<br/>

  appeared on most of them<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94243">Akrotiri<br/>

  the flag of the UK is used<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94244">Albania<br/>

  red with a black two-headed eagle in the center; the design<br/>

  is claimed to be that of 15th-century hero George Castriota<br/>

  SKANDERBERG, who led a successful uprising against the Turks that<br/>

  resulted in a short-lived independence for some Albanian regions<br/>

  (1443-1478); an unsubstantiated explanation for the eagle symbol is<br/>

  the tradition that Albanians see themselves as descendants of the<br/>

  eagle; they refer to themselves as "Shkypetars," which translates as<br/>

  "sons of the eagle"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94245">Algeria<br/>

  two equal vertical bands of green (hoist side) and white; a<br/>

  red, five-pointed star within a red crescent centered over the<br/>

  two-color boundary; the colors represent Islam (green), purity and<br/>

  peace (white), and liberty (red); the crescent and star are also<br/>

  Islamic symbols, but the crescent is more closed than those of other<br/>

  Muslim countries because the Algerians believe the long crescent<br/>

  horns bring happiness<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94246">American Samoa<br/>

  blue, with a white triangle edged in red that is<br/>

  based on the fly side and extends to the hoist side; a brown and<br/>

  white American bald eagle flying toward the hoist side is carrying<br/>

  two traditional Samoan symbols of authority, a war club known as a<br/>

  "Fa'alaufa'i" (upper; left talon), and a coconut fiber fly whisk<br/>

  known as a "Fue" (lower; right talon); the combination of symbols<br/>

  broadly mimics that seen on the US Great Seal and reflects the<br/>

  relationship between the United States and American Samoa<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94247">Andorra<br/>

  three vertical bands of blue (hoist side), yellow, and red,<br/>

  with the national coat of arms centered in the yellow band; the<br/>

  latter band is slightly wider than the other two so that the ratio<br/>

  of band widths is 8:9:8; the coat of arms features a quartered<br/>

  shield with the emblems of (starting in the upper left and<br/>

  proceeding clockwise): Urgell, Foix, Bearn, and Catalonia; the motto<br/>

  reads VIRTUS UNITA FORTIOR (Strength United is Stronger); the flag<br/>

  combines the blue and red French colors with the red and yellow of<br/>

  Spain to show Franco-Spanish protection<br/>

  note: similar to the flags of Chad and Romania, which do not have a<br/>

  national coat of arms in the center, and the flag of Moldova, which<br/>

  does bear a national emblem<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94248">Angola<br/>

  two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and black with a<br/>

  centered yellow emblem consisting of a five-pointed star within half<br/>

  a cogwheel crossed by a machete (in the style of a hammer and<br/>

  sickle); red represents liberty, black the African continent, the<br/>

  symbols characterize workers and peasants<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94249">Anguilla<br/>

  blue, with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side<br/>

  quadrant and the Anguillan coat of arms centered in the outer half<br/>

  of the flag; the coat of arms depicts three orange dolphins in an<br/>

  interlocking circular design on a white background with a<br/>

  turquoise-blue field below; the white in the background represents<br/>

  peace; the blue base symbolizes the surrounding sea, as well as<br/>

  faith, youth, and hope; the three dolphins stand for endurance,<br/>

  unity, and strength<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94250">Antigua and Barbuda<br/>

  red, with an inverted isosceles triangle based<br/>

  on the top edge of the flag; the triangle contains three horizontal<br/>

  bands of black (top), light blue, and white, with a yellow rising<br/>

  sun in the black band; the sun symbolizes the dawn of a new era,<br/>

  black represents the African heritage of most of the population,<br/>

  blue is for hope, and red is for the dynamism of the people; the "V"<br/>

  stands for victory; the successive yellow, blue, and white coloring<br/>

  is also meant to evoke the country's tourist attractions of sun,<br/>

  sea, and sand<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94251">Argentina<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of light blue (top), white,<br/>

  and light blue; centered in the white band is a radiant yellow sun<br/>

  with a human face known as the Sun of May; the colors represent the<br/>

  clear skies and snow of the Andes; the sun symbol commemorates the<br/>

  appearance of the sun through cloudy skies on 25 May 1810 during the<br/>

  first mass demonstration in favor of independence; the sun features<br/>

  are those of Inti, the Inca god of the sun<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94252">Armenia<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of red (top), blue, and orange;<br/>

  the color red recalls the blood shed for liberty, blue the Armenian<br/>

  skies as well as hope, and orange the land and the courage of the<br/>

  workers who farm it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94253">Aruba<br/>

  blue, with two narrow, horizontal, yellow stripes across the<br/>

  lower portion and a red, four-pointed star outlined in white in the<br/>

  upper hoist-side corner; the star represents Aruba and its red soil<br/>

  and white beaches, its four points the four major languages<br/>

  (Papiamento, Dutch, Spanish, English) as well as the four points of<br/>

  a compass, to indicate that its inhabitants come from all over the<br/>

  world; the blue symbolizes Caribbean waters and skies; the stripes<br/>

  represent the island's two main "industries": the flow of tourists<br/>

  to the sun-drenched beaches and the flow of minerals from the earth<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94254">Ashmore and Cartier Islands<br/>

  the flag of Australia is used<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94255">Australia<br/>

  blue with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side<br/>

  quadrant and a large seven-pointed star in the lower hoist-side<br/>

  quadrant known as the Commonwealth or Federation Star, representing<br/>

  the federation of the colonies of Australia in 1901; the star<br/>

  depicts one point for each of the six original states and one<br/>

  representing all of Australia's internal and external territories;<br/>

  on the fly half is a representation of the Southern Cross<br/>

  constellation in white with one small five-pointed star and four<br/>

  larger, seven-pointed stars<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94256">Austria<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and red;<br/>

  the flag design is certainly one of the oldest - if not the oldest -<br/>

  national banners in the world; according to tradition, in 1191,<br/>

  following a fierce battle in the Third Crusade, Duke Leopold V of<br/>

  Austria's white tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon<br/>

  removal of his wide belt or sash, a white band was revealed; the<br/>

  red-white-red color combination was subsequently adopted as his<br/>

  banner<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94257">Azerbaijan<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of blue (top), red, and<br/>

  green; a crescent and eight-pointed star in white are centered in<br/>

  the red band; the blue band recalls Azerbaijan's Turkic heritage,<br/>

  red stands for modernization and progress, and green refers to<br/>

  Islam; the crescent moon is an Islamic symbol, while the<br/>

  eight-pointed star represents the eight Turkic peoples of the world<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94258">Bahamas, The<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of aquamarine (top), gold,<br/>

  and aquamarine, with a black equilateral triangle based on the hoist<br/>

  side; the band colors represent the golden beaches of the islands<br/>

  surrounded by the aquamarine sea; black represents the vigor and<br/>

  force of a united people, while the pointing triangle indicates the<br/>

  enterprise and determination of the Bahamian people to develop the<br/>

  rich resources of land and sea<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94259">Bahrain<br/>

  red, the traditional color for flags of Persian Gulf states,<br/>

  with a white serrated band (five white points) on the hoist side;<br/>

  the five points represent the five pillars of Islam<br/>

  note: until 2002 the flag had eight white points, but this was<br/>

  reduced to five to avoid confusion with the Qatari flag<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94260">Bangladesh<br/>

  green field with a large red disk shifted slightly to the<br/>

  hoist side of center; the red disk represents the rising sun and the<br/>

  sacrifice to achieve independence; the green field symbolizes the<br/>

  lush vegetation of Bangladesh<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94261">Barbados<br/>

  three equal vertical bands of blue (hoist side), gold, and<br/>

  blue with the head of a black trident centered on the gold band; the<br/>

  band colors represent the blue of the sea and sky and the gold of<br/>

  the beaches; the trident head represents independence and a break<br/>

  with the past (the colonial coat of arms contained a complete<br/>

  trident)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94262">Belarus<br/>

  red horizontal band (top) and green horizontal band one-half<br/>

  the width of the red band; a white vertical stripe on the hoist side<br/>

  bears Belarusian national ornamentation in red; the red band color<br/>

  recalls past struggles from oppression, the green band represents<br/>

  hope and the many forests of the country<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94263">Belgium<br/>

  three equal vertical bands of black (hoist side), yellow,<br/>

  and red; the vertical design was based on the flag of France; the<br/>

  colors are those of the arms of the duchy of Brabant (yellow lion<br/>

  with red claws and tongue on a black field)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94264">Belize<br/>

  blue with a narrow red stripe along the top and the bottom<br/>

  edges; centered is a large white disk bearing the coat of arms; the<br/>

  coat of arms features a shield flanked by two workers in front of a<br/>

  mahogany tree with the related motto SUB UMBRA FLOREO (I Flourish in<br/>

  the Shade) on a scroll at the bottom, all encircled by a green<br/>

  garland of 50 mahogany leaves; the colors are those of the two main<br/>

  political parties: blue for the PUP and red for the UDP; various<br/>

  elements of the coat of arms - the figures, the tools, the mahogany<br/>

  tree, and the garland of leaves - recall the logging industry that<br/>

  led to British settlement of Belize<br/>

  note: Belize's flag is the only national flag that depicts human<br/>

  beings; two British overseas territories, Montserrat and the British<br/>

  Virgin Islands, also depict humans<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94265">Benin<br/>

  two equal horizontal bands of yellow (top) and red (bottom)<br/>

  with a vertical green band on the hoist side; green symbolizes hope<br/>

  and revival, yellow wealth, and red courage<br/>

  note: uses the popular Pan-African colors of Ethiopia<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94266">Bermuda<br/>

  red, with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side<br/>

  quadrant and the Bermudian coat of arms (a white shield with a red<br/>

  lion standing on a green grassy field holding a scrolled shield<br/>

  showing the sinking of the ship Sea Venture off Bermuda in 1609)<br/>

  centered on the outer half of the flag; it was the shipwreck of the<br/>

  vessel, filled with English colonists originally bound for Virginia,<br/>

  that led to settling of Bermuda<br/>

  note: the flag is unusual in that it is only British overseas<br/>

  territory that uses a red ensign, all others use blue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94267">Bhutan<br/>

  divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner; the<br/>

  upper triangle is yellow and the lower triangle is orange; centered<br/>

  along the dividing line is a large black and white dragon facing<br/>

  away from the hoist side; the dragon, called the Druk (Thunder<br/>

  Dragon), is the emblem of the nation; its white color stands for<br/>

  purity and the jewels in its claws symbolize wealth; the background<br/>

  colors represent spiritual and secular powers within Bhutan: the<br/>

  orange is associated with Bhuddism, while the yellow denotes the<br/>

  ruling dynasty<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94268">Bolivia<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of red (top), yellow, and green<br/>

  with the coat of arms centered on the yellow band; red stands for<br/>

  bravery and the blood of national heroes, yellow for the nation's<br/>

  mineral resources, and green for the fertility of the land<br/>

  note: similar to the flag of Ghana, which has a large black<br/>

  five-pointed star centered in the yellow band; in 2009, a<br/>

  presidential decree made it mandatory for a so-called wiphala - a<br/>

  square, multi-colored flag representing the country's indigenous<br/>

  peoples - to be used alongside the traditional flag<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94269">Bosnia and Herzegovina<br/>

  a wide medium blue vertical band on the fly<br/>

  side with a yellow isosceles triangle abutting the band and the top<br/>

  of the flag; the remainder of the flag is medium blue with seven<br/>

  full five-pointed white stars and two half stars top and bottom<br/>

  along the hypotenuse of the triangle; the triangle approximates the<br/>

  shape of the country and its three points stand for the constituent<br/>

  peoples - Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs; the stars represent Europe<br/>

  and are meant to be continuous (thus the half stars at top and<br/>

  bottom); the colors (white, blue, and yellow) are often associated<br/>

  with neutrality and peace, and traditionally are linked with Bosnia<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94270">Botswana<br/>

  light blue with a horizontal white-edged black stripe in<br/>

  the center; the blue symbolizes water in the form of rain, while the<br/>

  black and white bands represent racial harmony<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94271">Bouvet Island<br/>

  the flag of Norway is used<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94272">Brazil<br/>

  green with a large yellow diamond in the center bearing a<br/>

  blue celestial globe with 27 white five-pointed stars; the globe has<br/>

  a white equatorial band with the motto ORDEM E PROGRESSO (Order and<br/>

  Progress); the current flag was inspired by the banner of the former<br/>

  Empire of Brazil (1822-1889); on the imperial flag, the green<br/>

  represented the House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first Emperor of<br/>

  Brazil, while the yellow stood for the Habsburg Family of his wife;<br/>

  on the modern flag the green represents the forests of the country<br/>

  and the yellow rhombus its mineral wealth; the blue circle and<br/>

  stars, which replaced the coat of arms of the original flag, depict<br/>

  the sky over Rio de Janeiro on the morning of 15 November 1889 - the<br/>

  day the Republic of Brazil was declared; the number of stars has<br/>

  changed with the creation of new states and has risen from an<br/>

  original 21 to the current 27 (one for each state and the Federal<br/>

  District)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94273" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">British Indian Ocean Territory
  white with six blue wavy horizontal
  stripes; the flag of the UK is in the upper hoist-side quadrant; the
  striped section bears a palm tree and yellow crown (the symbols of
  the territory) centered on the outer half of the flag; the wavy
  stripes represent the Indian Ocean; although not officially
  described, the six blue stripes may stand for the six main atolls of
  the archipelago</p>

<p id="id94274">British Virgin Islands<br/>

  blue, with the flag of the UK in the upper<br/>

  hoist-side quadrant and the Virgin Islander coat of arms centered in<br/>

  the outer half of the flag; the coat of arms depicts a woman flanked<br/>

  on either side by a vertical column of six oil lamps above a scroll<br/>

  bearing the Latin word VIGILATE (Be Watchful); the islands were<br/>

  named by COLUMBUS in 1493 in honor of Saint Ursula and her 11 virgin<br/>

  followers (some sources say 11,000) who reputedly were martyred by<br/>

  the Huns in the 4th or 5th century; the figure on the banner holding<br/>

  a lamp represents the saint, the other lamps symbolize her followers<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94275">Brunei<br/>

  yellow with two diagonal bands of white (top, almost double<br/>

  width) and black starting from the upper hoist side; the national<br/>

  emblem in red is superimposed at the center; yellow is the color of<br/>

  royalty and symbolizes the sultanate; the white and black bands<br/>

  denote Brunei's chief ministers; the emblem includes five main<br/>

  components: a swallow-tailed flag, the royal umbrella representing<br/>

  the monarchy, the wings of four feathers symbolizing justice,<br/>

  tranquility, prosperity, and peace, the two upraised hands<br/>

  signifying the government's pledge to preserve and promote the<br/>

  welfare of the people, and the crescent moon denoting Islam, the<br/>

  state religion; the state motto "Always render service with God's<br/>

  guidance" appears in yellow Arabic script on the crescent; a ribbon<br/>

  below the crescent reads "Brunei, the Abode of Peace"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94276">Bulgaria<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of white (top), green, and<br/>

  red; the pan-Slavic white-blue-red colors were modified by<br/>

  substituting a green band (representing freedom) for the blue<br/>

  note: the national emblem, formerly on the hoist side of the white<br/>

  stripe, has been removed<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94277">Burkina Faso<br/>

  two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and green with<br/>

  a yellow five-pointed star in the center; red recalls the country's<br/>

  struggle for independence, green is for hope and abundance,and<br/>

  yellow represents the country's mineral wealth<br/>

  white with a diagonal red cross extending to the corners of<br/>

  the flag; in the upper quadrant, surmounted by a yellow crown, a red<br/>

  shield with three lions in yellow; according to tradition, the ships<br/>

  of Jersey - in an attempt to differentiate themselves from English<br/>

  ships flying the horizontal cross of St. George - rotated the cross<br/>

  to the "X" (saltire) configuration; because this arrangement still<br/>

  resembled the Irish cross of St. Patrick, the yellow Plantagenet<br/>

  crown and Jersey coat of arms were added<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94359">Jordan<br/>

  eagle, both centered on a sky blue background; the hoist side<br/>

  the ram) in gold; the blue color is of religious significance to the<br/>

  Turkic peoples of the country, and so symbolizes cultural and ethnic<br/>

  unity; it also represents the endless sky as well as water; the sun,<br/>

  a source of life and energy, exemplifies wealth and plenitude; the<br/>

  sun's rays are shaped like grain, which is the basis of abundance<br/>

  and prosperity; the eagle has appeared on the flags of Kazakh tribes<br/>

  for centuries and represents freedom, power, and the flight to the<br/>

  future<br/>
