  note: the other eight emirates are the seven that compose the UAE<br/>

  and the new shade was eventually adopted<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94425">Romania<br/>

  three equal vertical bands of blue (hoist side), yellow, and<br/>

  red; modeled after the flag of France, the colors are those of the<br/>

  principalities of Walachia (red and yellow) and Moldavia (red and<br/>

  three equal horizontal bands of white (top), blue, and red<br/>

  note: the colors may have been based on those of the Dutch flag;<br/>

  despite many popular interpretations, there is no official meaning<br/>

  assigned to the colors of the Russian flag; this flag inspired other<br/>

  Slav countries to adopt horizontal tricolors of the same colors but<br/>

  in different arrangements, and so red, blue, and white became the<br/>

  Pan-Slav colors<br/>
</p>

<p id="id94427">Rwanda<br/>
