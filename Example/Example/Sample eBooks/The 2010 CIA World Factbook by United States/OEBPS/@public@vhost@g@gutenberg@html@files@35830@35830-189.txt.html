  consultative member nations, non-consultative member nations,<br/>

  observer organizations, and expert organizations; decisions from<br/>

  national laws; more generally, access to the Antarctic Treaty area,<br/>

  that is to all areas between 60 and 90 degrees south latitude, is<br/>

  subject to a number of relevant legal instruments and authorization<br/>

  procedures adopted by the states party to the Antarctic Treaty; note<br/>

  - US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US<br/>

  nationals, such as murder, may apply extraterritorially; some US<br/>

  laws directly apply to Antarctica; for example, the Antarctic<br/>
