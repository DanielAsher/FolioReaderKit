  <body><p id="id00822" style="margin-top: 3em">Legislative branch</p>

<p id="id00823" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral,
bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of
office. Elections includes the nature of the election process or
accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next
election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or
number of seats held by each party in the last election.</p>

<p id="id00824" style="margin-top: 3em">Life expectancy at birth</p>

<p id="id00825" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a
group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age
remains constant in the future. The entry includes total population
as well as the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth
is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and
summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as
indicating the potential return on investment in human capital and
is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial measures.</p>

<p id="id00826" style="margin-top: 3em">Literacy</p>

<p id="id00827" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau
percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are
no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise
specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the
ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the
standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to
read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on
literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is
probably the most easily available and valid for international
comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can
impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly
changing, technology-driven world.</p>

<p id="id00828" style="margin-top: 3em">Location</p>

<p id="id00831" style="margin-top: 4em">Major infectious diseases</p>

<p id="id00832" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered
in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very
high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases
represent risks to US government personnel traveling to the
specified country for a period of less than three years. The degree
of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these
infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being
affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not
necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the
local population.
The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the
specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of
accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a
travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and
recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.
Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories
shown in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk.
Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual
country entries may vary according to local conditions.
food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on
the local economy:
Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of
the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated
with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims
exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will
experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.
Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the
functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal
contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,
abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.
Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food
or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit
sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.
vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected
arthropod:
Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;
transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;
parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting
in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death
due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to
the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of
cases and the majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths
occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.
Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease
associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of
fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and
hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.
Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from
influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;
occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where
most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.
Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus)
viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute
encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality
rates 30%.
African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa
Trypanosoma; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking
Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and,
in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous
system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan
Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the
parasites.
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa
leishmania; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results
in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries;
90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans
can act as reservoirs of infection.
Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated
with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible;
recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South
America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages;
manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes;
disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to
pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease;
infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or
tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle
East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and
muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose,
and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.
Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and
humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects;
infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or
contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and
southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are
generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the
disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular
disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.
Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease
associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever;
characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain
usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.
water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in
freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:
Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;
infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil
contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe
headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease
can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or
respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated
recovery can take months.
Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm
Schistosoma; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release
larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed
to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood
vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become
trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as
either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or
learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in
advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74
developing countries with 80% of infected people living in
sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.
aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation
of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:
Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;
endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct
contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or
fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50%
in epidemic outbreaks.
respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an
infectious person:
Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation
of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most
important bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of
its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high
fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person
to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and
prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often
with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases,
typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of
meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of
sub-Saharan Africa known as the "Meningitis Belt" which stretches
from Senegal east to Ethiopia.
animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local
animals:
Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the
bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the
central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms
initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to
neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of
symptoms.</p>

a country may be found. Note that boundary representations on these
maps are not necessarily authoritative. The entry on Geographic
coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.</p>

<p id="id00841" style="margin-top: 3em">Maritime claims</p>

<p id="id00842" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which
are excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive
descriptions:
territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond
its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,
described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this
sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as
well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right
to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not
exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the
breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the
coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the
coastal state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic
states.
contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a
zone contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it
may exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its
customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations
within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the
above laws and regulations committed within its territory or
territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24
nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the
territorial sea is measured (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical
mile contiguous zone in addition to its 12-nautical mile territorial
sea).
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ
as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a
coastal state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and
exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether
living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of
the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for
the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the
production of energy from the water, currents, and winds;
jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial
islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research;
the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer
limit of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical
miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial
sea is measured.
continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental
shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the
submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout
the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of
the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from
the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not
extend up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the
submerged prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and
consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the
rise; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical
miles from the baseline, coastal states may extend their claim to a
distance not to exceed 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100
nautical miles from the 2500 meter isobath; it does not include the
deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.
exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,
some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an
EEZ, but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off
their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often
used; the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or
200 nautical miles.</p>

<p id="id00843" style="margin-top: 3em">Market value of publicly traded shares</p>

<p id="id00844" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry gives the value of shares issued by publicly traded
companies at a price determined in the national stock markets on the
final day of the period indicated. It is simply the latest price per
share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares,
cumulated over all companies listed on the particular exchange.</p>

<p id="id00845" style="margin-top: 3em">Median age</p>

<p id="id00846" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically
equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and
half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age
distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from
a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several
European countries and Japan. See the entry for "Age structure" for
the importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by
implication, a low versus a higher median age.</p>

<p id="id00847" style="margin-top: 3em">Merchant marine</p>

<p id="id00848" style="margin-top: 2em">Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage
of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary
ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs,
etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total, ships
by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.
Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT
for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight
tonnage is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc.,
that a ship can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line.
GRT or gross register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the
entire sheltered volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers
and converting it to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton;
there is no stable relationship between GRT and DWT.
Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo
ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers,
combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas
tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers,
petroleum tankers, passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar
carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships,
short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.
Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong
to owners in another.
Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one
country but fly the flag of another.</p>

<p id="id00899" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of
significance not included elsewhere.</p>

<p id="id00900">Personal Names - Capitalization</p>

<p id="id00901" style="margin-top: 2em">The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals
for the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of
different cultures and naming conventions. The need for
capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other
indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following
examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU
SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam
Shah. By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital
letters can be used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman
Mao, President Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of
capitalization is extended to the names of leaders with surnames
that are not commonly used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For
Vietnamese names, the given name is capitalized because officials
are referred to by their given name rather than by their surname.
For example, the president of Vietnam is Tran Duc LUONG. His surname
is Tran, but he is referred to by his given name - President LUONG.</p>

<p id="id00902">Personal Names - Spelling</p>

<p id="id00903" style="margin-top: 2em">The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows
the same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic
Names for spelling place names. At times, however, a foreign leader
expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official
documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the
transliteration derived from the US Government standard. In such
cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.</p>

<p id="id00904">Personal Names - Titles</p>

<p id="id00905" style="margin-top: 2em">The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)
immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing alone is not
capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs
of state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier
is the head of the government, while in the US, the president is
both chief of state and head of government.</p>

of the Sea as any illegal act of violence, detention, or depredation
directed against a ship, aircraft, persons, or property in a place
outside the jurisdiction of any State. Such criminal acts committed

<p id="id00918" style="margin-top: 3em">Population</p>

<p id="id00919" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based
on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent
past and on assumptions about future trends. The total population
presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country
on the world and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993
Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)
have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The
Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi,
Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon,

<p id="id00920" style="margin-top: 3em">Population below poverty line</p>

<p id="id00921" style="margin-top: 2em">National estimates of the percentage of the population falling below
the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the
results weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions
of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example, rich
nations generally employ more generous standards of poverty than
poor nations.</p>

<p id="id00922" style="margin-top: 3em">Population growth rate</p>

<p id="id00923" style="margin-top: 2em">The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from
a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of
migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or
negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a
burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its
people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,
roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid
population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring
countries.</p>

<p id="id00924" style="margin-top: 3em">Ports and terminals</p>

<p id="id00925" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry lists major ports and terminals primarily on the basis of

<p id="id00935" style="margin-top: 3em">Refugees and internally displaced persons</p>

<p id="id00936" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees
or internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee
according to a United Nations Convention is "a person who is outside
his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a
well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,
nationality, membership in a particular social group or political
opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the
protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of
persecution." The UN established the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters
worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in
the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational definition for a
Palestinian refugee: "a person whose normal place of residence was
Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost
both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict."
However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not
covered under the UNRWA definition. The term "internally displaced
person" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it is used
to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons similar to
refugees, but who remain within their own national territory and are
subject to the laws of that state.</p>

<p id="id00937" style="margin-top: 3em">Religions</p>

<p id="id00938" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting
with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total
population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's
major religions are described below.
Baha'i - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran
in 1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one
eternal transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the
unity of all peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be
achieved on earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major
world religions reflect some truth or element of the divine,
believes all were manifestations of God given to specific
communities in specific times, and that Baha'u'llah is an additional
prophet meant to call all humankind. Bahais are an open community,
located worldwide, with the greatest concentration of believers in
South Asia.
Buddhism - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C.
teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha "the
enlightened one"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual
enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four
Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path
of spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of
which we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of
rebirth. Several schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing
often on the nature of the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment
can be achieved - for one or for all, and by whom - religious orders
or laity.
Basic Groupings
   Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is
practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand,
with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West.
Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe
that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and
suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several
lifetimes.
   Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan Buddhism:
Forms of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and
parts of the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the
Pali Canon and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching.
Unlike Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the
Buddha-nature is present in all beings and all will ultimately
achieve enlightenment.
Christianity - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central
belief maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the
Hebrew Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are
salvific for the world. Christianity is one of the three
monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which
traces its spiritual lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Its sacred texts include the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or
the Christian Gospels).
Basic Groupings
   Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest
established western Christian church and the world's largest single
religious body. It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical
structure with the Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at
the Vatican. Catholics believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head
of the Church from a direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle
Peter. Catholicism is comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites
- one Western (Roman or Latin-Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite
is by far the largest, making up about 98% of Catholic membership.
Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the Maronite Church and the Ukrainian
Catholic Church, are in communion with Rome although they preserve
their own worship traditions and their immediate hierarchy consists
of clergy within their own rite. The Catholic Church has a
comprehensive theological and moral doctrine specified for believers
in its catechism, which makes it unique among most forms of
Christianity.
   Mormonism (including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints): Originating in 1830 in the United States under Joseph
Smith, Mormonism is not characterized as a form of Protestant
Christianity because it claims additional revealed Christian
scriptures after the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. The Book of
Mormon maintains there was an appearance of Jesus in the New World
following the Christian account of his resurrection, and that the
Americas are uniquely blessed continents. Mormonism believes earlier
Christian traditions, such as the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and
Protestant reform faiths, are apostasies and that Joseph Smith's
revelation of the Book of Mormon is a restoration of true
Christianity. Mormons have a hierarchical religious leadership
structure, and actively proselytize their faith; they are located
primarily in the Americas and in a number of other Western countries.
   Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of
Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the
Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but
its various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox,
Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent
of Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs).
Orthodox churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox
Christian faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman
Catholic Church, but diverges on some key premises and does not
recognize the governing authority of the Pope.
   Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in
the 16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's
practices, dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or
denominations which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs,
relationship to state, clergy, and governance. Many protestant
theologies emphasize the primary role of scripture in their faith,
advocating individual interpretation of Christian texts without the
mediation of a final religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The
oldest Protestant Christianities include Lutheranism, Calvinism
(Presbyterians), and Anglican Christianity (Episcopalians), which
have established liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy.
Other variants on Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal
movements and independent churches, may lack one or more of these
elements, and their leadership and beliefs are individualized and
dynamic.
Hinduism - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second
and first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of
beliefs and practices with no single founder or religious authority.
Hinduism has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the
Bhagavad-Gita are among some of the most important. Hindus may
worship one or many deities, usually with prayer rituals within
their own home. The most common figures of devotion are the gods
Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the
soul, or atman, is eternal, and goes through a cycle of birth,
death, and rebirth (samsara) determined by one's positive or
negative karma, or the consequences of one's actions. The goal of
religious life is to learn to act so as to finally achieve
liberation (moksha) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle.
Islam - The third of the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam
originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century.
Muslims believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets
(beginning with Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic
scripture, was revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word
submission, and obedience to God is a primary theme in this
religion. In order to live an Islamic life, believers must follow
the five pillars, or tenets, of Islam, which are the testimony of
faith (shahada), daily prayer (salah), giving alms (zakah), fasting
during Ramadan (sawm), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).
Basic Groupings
   The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split
from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about
the rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's
cousin and son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam
(religious leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs
after Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam,
Sunnis and Shia continue to have different views of acceptable
schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic
religious authority. Islam also has an active mystical branch,
Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia subsets.
    Sunni Islam accounts for over 75% of the world's Muslim
population. It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after
Muhammad. Sunni has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law -
Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the
Hadith, or recorded oral traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may
elect to follow any one of these schools, as all are considered
equally valid.
    Shia Islam represents 10-20% of Muslims worldwide, and its
distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible,
divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim
community after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as
"Twelvers," because they believe that the 11 familial successor
imams after Muhammad culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is
hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the
righteous.
Variants
   Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known
as "Seveners," because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam
in Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar
al-Sadiq. Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as
the Mahdi, or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in
various parts of the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant.
   Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects
followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are
a closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia
Muslims, although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have
a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East.
Alawis live mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.
   Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community
that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are
thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing
that the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key
aspects of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the
word, the soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key
presence in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.
Jainism - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes
in an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of
"the own nature of things." It emphasizes compassion for all living
things, seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation
through enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the
belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain
philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for
monks and laity alike; its adherents are a highly influential
religious minority in Indian society.
Judaism - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely
dating to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the
Jewish people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility
between a sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of
Judaism's Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. Divine revelation of principles
and prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish
law, or halakhah, which is a key component of the faith. While there
are extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological
discourse, there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition.
Local communities have their own religious leadership. Modern
Judaism has three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative,
and Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of
Jewish law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional
practice, and Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of
individualized interpretations of Jewish identity and faith.
Shintoism - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is
based upon the premise that every being and object has its own
spirit or kami. Shinto practitioners worship several particular
kamis, including the kamis of nature, and families often have
shrines to their ancestors' kamis. Shintoism has no fixed tradition
of prayers or prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual
ritual. Respect for the kamis in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior
to the end of World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan,
and bolstered the cult of the Japanese emperor.
Sikhism - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in
a non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering
one's devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of
rebirth. Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent
gurus. Their scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the
Adi Granth - is considered the living Guru, or final authority of
Sikh faith and theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind
and disavows caste, class, or gender discrimination.
Taoism - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te
Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow
of the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a
principle of non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously
with the Tao. Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a
perfect harmonious balance and nature, while in the manifest world -
particularly in the body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of
the Tao - compassion, simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis
for Taoist ethics.
Zoroastrianism - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in
about the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest
continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a
transcendent creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will.
The key ethical tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture,
the Avesta, are based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent
chaos if one chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good
words, and good deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion
and members are almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to
the spread of Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today,
though a minority, Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India, and
Pakistan.</p>

groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over,
and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently
emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in
some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian
countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and
infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect
future marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it
could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to find

submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe with North America.
Telefax - facsimile service between subscriber stations via the
public switched telephone network or the international Datel network.
Telegraph - a telecommunications system designed for unmodulated
electric impulse transmission.
Telex - a communication service involving teletypewriters connected
by wire through automatic exchanges.
Tropospheric scatter - a form of microwave radio transmission in
which the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of
the incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional
antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals;
reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances
up to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the
range of this system for very long distances.
Trunk network - a network of switching centers, connected by
multichannel trunk lines.
UHF - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to
3,000-MHz range.

range.</p>

<p id="id00965" style="margin-top: 3em">Telephones - main lines in use</p>

<p id="id00966" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry gives the total number of main telephone lines in use.</p>

<p id="id00967" style="margin-top: 3em">Telephones - mobile cellular</p>

<p id="id00968" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephone
subscribers.</p>

<p id="id00969">Terminology</p>

<p id="id00970" style="margin-top: 2em">Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some
collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word
Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of
dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and
other entities in addition to the traditional countries or
independent states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for
various civil defense, security, and defense activities in many
entries. The Independence entry includes the usual colonial
independence dates and former ruling states as well as other
significant nationhood dates such as the traditional founding date
or the date of unification, federation, confederation,
establishment, or state succession that are not strictly
independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their
dependency status noted in this same entry.</p>

<p id="id00971" style="margin-top: 3em">Terrain</p>

<p id="id00972" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry contains a brief description of the topography.</p>

<p id="id00973">Time difference</p>

<p id="id00974" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two ways. First, it
is stated as the difference in hours between the capital of an
entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during Standard Time.
Additionally, the difference in time between the capital of an
entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided. Note
that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously
observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.</p>

<p id="id00975">Time zones</p>

<p id="id00976" style="margin-top: 2em">Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States) and the
island of Greenland observe more than one official time depending on
the number of designated time zones within their boundaries. An
illustration of time zones throughout the world and within countries
can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World map included in
the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.</p>

<p id="id00977" style="margin-top: 3em">Total fertility rate</p>

<p id="id00978" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that
would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their
childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility
rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct
measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since
it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential
for population change in the country. A rate of two children per
woman is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting
in relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two
children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age
is declining. Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for
families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children and
for women to enter the labor force. Rates below two children
indicate populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global
fertility rates are in general decline and this trend is most
pronounced in industrialized countries, especially Western Europe,
where populations are projected to decline dramatically over the
next 50 years.</p>

<p id="id00979" style="margin-top: 3em">Total renewable water resources</p>

<p id="id00980" style="margin-top: 2em">This entry provides the long-term average water availability for a
country in cubic kilometers of precipitation, recharged ground
water, and surface inflows from surrounding countries. The values
have been adjusted to account for overlap resulting from surface
flow recharge of groundwater sources. Total renewable water
resources provides the water total available to a country but does
not include water resource totals that have been reserved for
upstream or downstream countries through international agreements.
Note that these values are averages and do not accurately reflect
the total available in any given year. Annual available resources
can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and
weather variations.</p>

<p id="id00981" style="margin-top: 3em">Trafficking in persons</p>

<p id="id00982" style="margin-top: 2em">Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who
are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation.
The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged
with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection
issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in
forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude,
and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a
multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and
freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown,
inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human
capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000,
the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act
(TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the
US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad.
One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department
of State's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the
government response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150
countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across
their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or
obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the
annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts
to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are
those listed in the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2
Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following tier rating definitions:
Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making
significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:
1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,
2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat trafficking in persons, or,
3. they have committed to take action over the next year.
Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to
do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential
non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.</p>
