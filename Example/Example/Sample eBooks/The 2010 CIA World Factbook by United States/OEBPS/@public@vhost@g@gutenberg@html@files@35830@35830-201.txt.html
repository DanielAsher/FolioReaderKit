  <body><p id="id100983">American Samoa<br/>

  American Samoa has a traditional Polynesian economy<br/>

  in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic<br/>

  activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa<br/>

  conducts most of its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing<br/>

  plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the<br/>

  primary export. The two tuna canneries account for 80% of<br/>

  employment. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting<br/>

  tsunami devastated American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting<br/>

  transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200<br/>

  deaths. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency is overseeing a<br/>

  relief program of nearly $25 million. Transfers from the US<br/>

  Government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well<br/>

  being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader<br/>

  economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited<br/>

  transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a<br/>

  promising developing sector.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100984">Andorra<br/>

  Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy,<br/>

  accounts for more than 80% of GDP. An estimated 11 million tourists<br/>

  visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status for some<br/>

  products and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative<br/>

  advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain<br/>

  opened, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs.<br/>

  The banking sector, with its partial "tax haven" status, also<br/>

  contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is<br/>

  limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most food has to be<br/>

  imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.<br/>

  Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and<br/>

  furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is<br/>

  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)<br/>

  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100985" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Angola
  Angola's high growth rate in recent years was driven by high
  international prices for its oil. Angola became a member of OPEC in
  late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9
  million barrels a day (bbl/day), somewhat less than the 2-2.5
  million bbl/day Angola's government had wanted. Oil production and
  its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond
  exports contribute an additional 5%. Subsistence agriculture
  provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the
  country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported
  growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar
  reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to
  high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much
  of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from
  the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left from the war still mar
  the countryside, even though peace was established after the death
  of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Since 2005, the
  government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China,
  Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to rebuild Angola's
  public infrastructure. The global recession temporarily stalled
  economic growth. Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global
  recession led to a contraction in GDP in 2009, and many construction
  projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to
  foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008
  and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November
  2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to
  rebuild international reserves. Although consumer inflation declined
  from 325% in 2000 to under 14% in 2010, Luanda has been unable to
  reduce inflation below 10%. The Angolan kwanza depreciated again in
  mid 2010, which, along with higher oil prices, should boost economic
  growth in all sectors. Corruption, especially in the extractive
  sectors, also is a major challenge.</p>

<p id="id100986">Anguilla<br/>

  Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy depends<br/>

  heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and<br/>

  remittances from emigrants. Increased activity in the tourism<br/>

  industry has spurred the growth of the construction sector<br/>

  contributing to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put<br/>

  substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector,<br/>

  which is small but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the<br/>

  economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on<br/>

  revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on<br/>

  favorable weather conditions.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100987">Antarctica<br/>

  Scientific undertakings rather than commercial pursuits<br/>

  are the predominate human activity in Antarctica. Fishing off the<br/>

  coast and tourism, both based abroad, account for Antarctica's<br/>

  limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries, targeting three main<br/>

  species - Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus<br/>

  eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus<br/>

  gunnari), and krill (Euphausia superba) - reported landing 141,147<br/>

  metric tons in 2008-09 (1 July - 30 June). (Estimated fishing is<br/>

  from the area covered by the Convention on the Conservation of<br/>

  Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which extends slightly<br/>

  beyond the Antarctic Treaty area.) Unregulated fishing, particularly<br/>

  of Patagonian toothfish (also known as Chilean sea bass), is a<br/>

  serious problem. The CCAMLR determines the recommended catch limits<br/>

  for marine species. A total of 37,858 tourists visited the Antarctic<br/>

  Treaty area in the 2008-09 Antarctic summer, down from the 46,265<br/>

  visitors in 2007-2008 (estimates provided to the Antarctic Treaty by<br/>

  the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO);<br/>

  this does not include passengers on overflights). Nearly all of them<br/>

  were passengers on commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several<br/>

  yachts that make trips during the summer.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100988">Antigua and Barbuda<br/>

  Tourism continues to dominate Antigua and<br/>

  Barbuda's economy, accounting for nearly 60% of GDP and 40% of<br/>

  investment. The dual-island nation's agricultural production is<br/>

  focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water<br/>

  supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages<br/>

  in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type<br/>

  assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts,<br/>

  and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the<br/>

  medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US,<br/>

  Canada, and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters.<br/>

  After taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government adopted an<br/>

  ambitious fiscal reform program, and was successful in reducing its<br/>

  public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120% to about 90% in 2008. However,<br/>

  the global financial crisis that began in 2008, has led to a<br/>

  significant increase in the national debt, which topped 130% at the<br/>

  end of 2010. The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003<br/>

  to 2007, reaching over 12% in 2006 driven by a construction boom in<br/>

  hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup, but growth<br/>

  dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom. In 2009, Antigua's<br/>

  economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis, suffering<br/>

  from the collapse of its largest financial institution and a steep<br/>

  decline in tourism. This decline continued in 2010 as the country<br/>

  struggled with a yawning budget deficit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100989">Arctic Ocean<br/>

  Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of<br/>

  natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100990" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Argentina
  Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly
  literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
  diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
  countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th
  century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and
  current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt,
  and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external
  indebtedness, and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious
  economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent
  history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default -
  the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in
  December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after
  taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to
  the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002.
  The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than
  in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real
  GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the
  subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled
  industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and
  reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions,
  and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also
  increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor
  KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as
  well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in early 2007,
  with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER
  succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid
  economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the
  following year as government policies held back exports and the
  world economy fell into recession. The economy has rebounded from
  the 2009 recession, but the government's continued reliance on
  expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already
  high inflation, which remains under-reported by official statistics.</p>

<p id="id100991" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Armenia
  After several years of double-digit economic growth, Armenia
  faced a severe economic recession with GDP declining more than 14%
  in 2009, despite large loans from multilateral institutions. Sharp
  declines in the construction sector and workers' remittances,
  particularly from Russia, were the main reasons for the downturn.
  The economy began to recover in 2010 with nearly 5% growth. Under
  the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern
  industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other
  manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw
  materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale
  agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the
  Soviet era. Armenia has managed to reduce poverty, slash inflation,
  stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized
  enterprises. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia
  had made progress in implementing some economic reforms, including
  privatization, price reforms, and prudent fiscal policies, but
  geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies
  in important business sectors have made Armenia particularly
  vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the
  economic downturn in Russia. The conflict with Azerbaijan over the
  ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to
  a severe economic decline in the early 1990s and Armenia's borders
  with Turkey remain closed until 2010, when Turkey and Armenia signed
  an accord to reestablish diplomatic relations. Armenia is
  particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental
  support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or
  managed, especially in the energy sector. The electricity
  distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's
  RAO-UES in 2005. Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas
  from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas
  deliveries are slated to expand due to the April 2010 completion of
  the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. Armenia has some mineral deposits
  (copper, gold, bauxite). Pig iron, unwrought copper, and other
  nonferrous metals are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's
  severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international
  aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct
  investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government
  made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent
  years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective and the
  current economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax revenue and
  forced the government to accept large loan packages from Russia, the
  IMF, and other international financial institutions. Armenia will
  need to pursue additional economic reforms in order to regain
  economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment
  opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of
  its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.</p>

<p id="id100992">Aruba<br/>

  Tourism is the mainstay of the small open Aruban economy,<br/>

  together with offshore banking. Oil refining and storage ended in<br/>

  2009. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade<br/>

  has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities. Over<br/>

  1.5 million tourists per year visit Aruba with 75% of those from the<br/>

  US. Construction continues to boom with hotel capacity five times<br/>

  the 1985 level. Tourist arrivals rebounded strongly following a dip<br/>

  after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The government has made cutting<br/>

  the budget and trade deficits a high priority.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100993">Ashmore and Cartier Islands<br/>

  no economic activity<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100994">Atlantic Ocean<br/>

  The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world's most<br/>

  heavily trafficked sea routes, between and within the Eastern and<br/>

  Western Hemispheres. Other economic activity includes the<br/>

  exploitation of natural resources, e.g., fishing, dredging of<br/>

  aragonite sands (The Bahamas), and production of crude oil and<br/>

  natural gas (Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100995">Australia<br/>

  Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract<br/>

  high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of<br/>

  coal, iron ore, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable<br/>

  energy sources. A series of major investments, such as the US$40<br/>

  billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand<br/>

  the resources sector. Australia also has a large services sector and<br/>

  is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food.<br/>

  Key tenets of Australia's trade policy include support for open<br/>

  trade and the successful culmination of the Doha Round of<br/>

  multilateral trade negotiations, particularly for agriculture and<br/>

  services. The Australian economy grew for 17 consecutive years<br/>

  before the global financial crisis. Subsequently, the Rudd<br/>

  government introduced a fiscal stimulus package worth over US$50<br/>

  billion to offset the effect of the slowing world economy, while the<br/>

  Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to historic lows. These<br/>

  policies - and continued demand for commodities, especially from<br/>

  China - helped the Australian economy rebound after just one quarter<br/>

  of negative growth. The economy grew by 1.2% during 2009 - the best<br/>

  performance in the OECD. Unemployment, originally expected to reach<br/>

  8-10%, peaked at 5.7% in late 2009 and fell to 5.1% in 2010. As a<br/>

  result of an improved economy, the budget deficit is expected to<br/>

  peak below 4.2% of GDP and the government could return to budget<br/>

  surpluses as early as 2015. Australia was one of the first advanced<br/>

  economies to raise interest rates, with seven rate hikes between<br/>

  October 2009 and November 2010. The GILLARD government is focused on<br/>

  raising Australia's economic productivity to ensure the<br/>

  sustainability of growth, and continues to manage the symbiotic, but<br/>

  sometimes tense, economic relationship with China. Australia is<br/>

  engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and ongoing free<br/>

  trade agreement negotiations with China, Japan, and Korea.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100996">Austria<br/>

  Austria, with its well-developed market economy and high<br/>

  standard of living, is closely tied to other EU economies,<br/>

  especially Germany's. Its economy features a large service sector, a<br/>

  sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed<br/>

  agricultural sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand<br/>

  for Austrian exports and record employment growth, the international<br/>

  financial crisis and global economic downturn in 2008 led to a<br/>

  recession that persisted until the third quarter of 2009. Austrian<br/>

  GDP contracted 3.8% in 2009 but saw positive growth of about 2% in<br/>

  2010. Unemployment has not risen as steeply in Austria as elsewhere<br/>

  in Europe, partly because its government has subsidized reduced<br/>

  working hour schemes to allow companies to retain employees. Such<br/>

  stabilization measures, stimulus initiatives, and the government's<br/>

  income tax reforms pushed the budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2009<br/>

  and about 5% in 2010, from only about 1.3% in 2008. The<br/>

  international financial crisis caused difficulties for some of<br/>

  Austria's largest banks whose extensive operations in central,<br/>

  eastern, and southeastern Europe faced large losses. The government<br/>

  provided bank support - including in some instances, nationalization<br/>

  - to prevent insolvency and possible regional contagion. In the<br/>

  medium-term all large Austrian banks will need additional capital.<br/>

  Even after the global economic outlook improves, Austria will need<br/>

  to continue restructuring, emphasizing knowledge-based sectors of<br/>

  the economy, and encouraging greater labor flexibility and greater<br/>

  labor participation to offset growing unemployment and Austria's<br/>

  aging population and exceedingly low fertility rate.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100997">Azerbaijan<br/>

  Azerbaijan's high economic growth during 2006-08 was<br/>

  attributable to large and growing oil exports, but some non-export<br/>

  sectors also featured double-digit growth, spurred by growth in the<br/>

  construction, banking, and real estate sectors. In 2009, economic<br/>

  growth remained above 9% even as oil prices moderated and growth in<br/>

  the construction sector cooled. In 2010, economic growth slowed to<br/>

  approximately 3.7%, although the impact of the global financial<br/>

  crisis was less severe than in many other countries in the region.<br/>

  The current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for<br/>

  the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008<br/>

  highs, highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and<br/>

  lackluster attempts to diversify its economy. Azerbaijan's oil<br/>

  production increased dramatically in 1997, when Azerbaijan signed<br/>

  the first production-sharing arrangement (PSA) with the Azerbaijan<br/>

  International Operating Company. Oil exports through the<br/>

  Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while<br/>

  efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. However,<br/>

  Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting<br/>

  market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector<br/>

  corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on<br/>

  long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other<br/>

  obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for<br/>

  stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the<br/>

  continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.<br/>

  Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining<br/>

  in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations<br/>

  of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the<br/>

  location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, and<br/>

  Azerbaijan's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote<br/>

  sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur<br/>

  employment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100998">Bahamas, The<br/>

  The Bahamas is one of the wealthiest Caribbean<br/>

  countries with an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore<br/>

  banking. Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and<br/>

  manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or<br/>

  indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Prior to<br/>

  2006, a steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction<br/>

  of new hotels, resorts, and residences led to solid GDP growth but<br/>

  since then tourism receipts have begun to drop off. The global<br/>

  recession in 2009 took a sizeable toll on the Bahamas, resulting in<br/>

  a contraction in GDP and a widening budget deficit. The decline<br/>

  continued in 2010 as tourism from the US and sector investment<br/>

  lagged. Financial services constitute the second-most important<br/>

  sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined with business<br/>

  services, account for about 36% of GDP. However, the financial<br/>

  sector currently is smaller than it has been in the past because of<br/>

  the enactment of new and more strict financial regulations in 2000<br/>

  that caused many international businesses to relocate elsewhere.<br/>

  Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute approximately a<br/>

  tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives<br/>

  aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run<br/>

  rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id100999">Bahrain<br/>

  Bahrain is one of the most diversified economies in the<br/>

  Persian Gulf. Highly developed communication and transport<br/>

  facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with<br/>

  business in the Gulf. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain<br/>

  implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006,<br/>

  the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Bahrain's economy,<br/>

  however, continues to depend heavily on oil. Petroleum production<br/>

  and refining account for more than 60% of Bahrain's export receipts,<br/>

  70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP (exclusive of allied<br/>

  industries). Other major economic activities are production of<br/>

  aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and<br/>

  construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center<br/>

  for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies<br/>

  as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum<br/>

  industries. Unemployment, especially among the young, is a long-term<br/>

  economic problem Bahrain struggles to address. In 2009, to help<br/>

  lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals, Bahrain reduced<br/>

  sponsorship for expatriate workers, increasing the costs of<br/>

  employing foreign labor. The global financial crisis caused funding<br/>

  for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic<br/>

  growth for Bahrain. Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow<br/>

  growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program,<br/>

  the financing of large government projects, and debt restructuring,<br/>

  such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101000">Bangladesh<br/>

  The economy has grown 5-6% per year since 1996 despite<br/>

  political instability, poor infrastructure, corruption, insufficient<br/>

  power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms.<br/>

  Bangladesh remains a poor, overpopulated, and inefficiently-governed<br/>

  nation. Although more than half of GDP is generated through the<br/>

  service sector, 45% of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture<br/>

  sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Bangladesh's<br/>

  growth was resilient during the 2008-09 global financial crisis and<br/>

  recession. Garment exports, totaling $12.3 billion in FY09 and<br/>

  remittances from overseas Bangladeshis totaling $9.7 billion in FY09<br/>

  accounted for almost 25% of GDP.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101001">Barbados<br/>

  Historically, the Barbadian economy was dependent on<br/>

  sugarcane cultivation and related activities. However, in recent<br/>

  years the economy has diversified into light industry and tourism<br/>

  with about three-quarters of GDP and 80% of exports being attributed<br/>

  to services. Growth has rebounded since 2003, bolstered by increases<br/>

  in construction projects and tourism revenues, reflecting its<br/>

  success in the higher-end segment, but the sector faced declining<br/>

  revenues in 2009 with the global economic downturn. The country<br/>

  enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the region. Offshore<br/>

  finance and information services are important foreign exchange<br/>

  earners and thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US<br/>

  financial centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. The<br/>

  government continues its efforts to reduce unemployment, to<br/>

  encourage direct foreign investment, and to privatize remaining<br/>

  state-owned enterprises. The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over<br/>

  100% in 2009, largely because a sharp slowdown in tourism and<br/>

  financial services led to a wide budget deficit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101002">Belarus<br/>

  Belarus has seen limited structural reform since 1995, when<br/>

  President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of "market<br/>

  socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed<br/>

  administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and<br/>

  expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private<br/>

  enterprises. Since 2005, the government has re-nationalized a number<br/>

  of private companies. In addition, businesses have been subjected to<br/>

  pressure by central and local governments, including arbitrary<br/>

  changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive<br/>

  application of new business regulations, and arrests of "disruptive"<br/>

  businessmen and factory owners. Continued state control over<br/>

  economic operations hampers market entry for businesses, both<br/>

  domestic and foreign. Government statistics indicate GDP growth was<br/>

  strong, surpassing 10% in 2008, despite the roadblocks of a tough,<br/>

  centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation and a low<br/>

  rate of unemployment. However, the global crisis pushed the country<br/>

  into recession in 2009, and GDP grew only 0.2% for the year.<br/>

  Slumping foreign demand hit the industrial sector hard. Minsk has<br/>

  depended on a standby-agreement with the IMF to assist with balance<br/>

  of payments shortfalls. In line with IMF conditions, in 2009,<br/>

  Belarus devalued the ruble more than 40% and tightened some fiscal<br/>

  and monetary policies. On 1 January 2010, Russia, Kazakhstan and<br/>

  Belarus launched a customs union, with unified trade regulations and<br/>

  customs codes still under negotiation. In late January, Russia and<br/>

  Belarus amended their 2007 oil supply agreement. The new terms<br/>

  raised prices for above quota purchases, increasing Belarus' current<br/>

  account deficit. GDP grew 4.8% in 2010, in part, on the strength of<br/>

  renewed export growth. In December 2010, Belarus, Russia and<br/>

  Kazakhstan signed an agreement to form a Common Economic Space and<br/>

  Russia removed all Belarusian oil duties.<br/>

<p id="id101003">Belgium<br/>

  This modern, private-enterprise economy has capitalized on<br/>

  its central geographic location, highly developed transport network,<br/>

  and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is<br/>

  concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With<br/>

  few natural resources, Belgium imports substantial quantities of raw<br/>

  materials and exports a large volume of manufactures, making its<br/>

  economy vulnerable to volatility in world markets. Roughly<br/>

  three-quarters of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. In<br/>

  2009 Belgian GDP contracted by 2.7%, the unemployment rate rose<br/>

  slightly, and the budget deficit worsened because of large-scale<br/>

  bail-outs in the financial sector. Belgium's budget deficit widened<br/>

  to 4.8% of GDP in 2010, while public debt was just over 100% of GDP.<br/>

  Belgian banks have been severely affected by the international<br/>

  financial crisis with three major banks receiving capital injections<br/>

  from the government. An ageing population and rising social<br/>

  expenditures are also increasing pressure on public finances, making<br/>

  it likely the government will need to implement unpopular austerity<br/>

  measures to assuage investor concerns about Belgium's ability to<br/>

  restore fiscal balance.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101004">Belize<br/>

  In this small, essentially private-enterprise economy,<br/>

  tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner followed by<br/>

  exports of marine products, citrus, cane sugar, bananas, and<br/>

  garments. The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal<br/>

  policies, initiated in September 1998, led to sturdy GDP growth<br/>

  averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007, though growth slipped to 3.8% in<br/>

  2008, 0% in 2009, and 1.5% in 2010 as a result of the global<br/>

  slowdown, natural disasters, and the drop in the price of oil. Oil<br/>

  discoveries in 2006 bolstered economic growth. Exploration efforts<br/>

  continue and production increased a small amount in 2009. Major<br/>

  concerns continue to be the sizable trade deficit and heavy foreign<br/>

  debt burden. In February 2007, the government restructured nearly<br/>

  all of its public external commercial debt, which helped reduce<br/>

  interest payments and relieved some of the country's liquidity<br/>

  concerns. A key objective remains the reduction of poverty and<br/>

  inequality with the help of international donors.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101005">Benin<br/>

  The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on<br/>

  subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade.<br/>

  Growth in real output had averaged about 4% before the global<br/>

  recession, but fell to 2.5% in 2009 and 3% in 2010. Inflation has<br/>

  subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth,<br/>

  Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis<br/>

  on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing<br/>

  systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and<br/>

  communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business<br/>

  climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice<br/>

  system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307<br/>

  million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006.<br/>

  The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications,<br/>

  water, electricity, and agriculture. As result of these reforms,<br/>

  Benin has become the most competitive country in the West African<br/>

  Economic and Monetary Union, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>

  The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt<br/>

  situation, with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction announced<br/>

  in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An<br/>

  insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's<br/>

  economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to<br/>

  increase domestic power production.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101006">Bermuda<br/>

  Bermuda enjoys the third highest per capita income in the<br/>

  world, more than 50% higher than that of the US; the average cost of<br/>

  a house by the mid-2000s exceeded $1,000,000. Its economy is<br/>

  primarily based on providing financial services for international<br/>

  business and luxury facilities for tourists. A number of reinsurance<br/>

  companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001<br/>

  attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005<br/>

  contributing to the expansion of an already robust international<br/>

  business sector. Bermuda's tourism industry - which derives over 80%<br/>

  of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle but remains the<br/>

  island's number two industry. Most capital equipment and food must<br/>

  be imported. Bermuda's industrial sector is largely focused on<br/>

  construction and agriculture is limited, with only 20% of the land<br/>

  being arable.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101007">Bhutan<br/>

  The economy, one of the world's smallest and least developed,<br/>

  is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main<br/>

  livelihood for more than 60% of the population. Agriculture consists<br/>

  largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged<br/>

  mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and<br/>

  other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely<br/>

  aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and<br/>

  dependence on India's financial assistance. The industrial sector is<br/>

  technologically backward, with most production of the cottage<br/>

  industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction,<br/>

  rely on Indian migrant labor. Model education, social, and<br/>

  environment programs are underway with support from multilateral<br/>

  development organizations. Each economic program takes into account<br/>

  the government's desire to protect the country's environment and<br/>

  cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious<br/>

  expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale,<br/>

  environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and<br/>

  uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade,<br/>

  labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. Hydropower<br/>

  exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth. New<br/>

  hydropower projects will be the driving force behind Bhutan's<br/>

  ability to create employment and sustain growth in the coming years.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101008">Bolivia<br/>

  Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries<br/>

  in Latin America. Following a disastrous economic crisis during the<br/>

  early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic<br/>

  growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was<br/>

  characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent<br/>

  protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export<br/>

  Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern<br/>

  hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial<br/>

  hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and<br/>

  required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts<br/>

  to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange<br/>

  for a predetermined service fee. After higher prices for mining and<br/>

  hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in 2008, the global<br/>

  recession in 2009 slowed growth. A decline in commodity prices that<br/>

  began in late 2008, a lack of foreign investment in the mining and<br/>

  hydrocarbon sectors, a poor infrastructure, and the suspension of<br/>

  trade benefits with the United States will pose challenges for the<br/>

  Bolivian economy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101009">Bosnia and Herzegovina<br/>

  The interethnic warfare in Bosnia and<br/>

  Herzegovina caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995<br/>

  and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output<br/>

  recovered in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but<br/>

  output growth slowed in 2000-02. Part of the lag in output was made<br/>

  up in 2003-08 when GDP growth exceeded 5% per year. However, the<br/>

  country experienced negative GDP growth of almost 3% in 2009 due in<br/>

  large part to a reduction in exports caused by the global economic<br/>

  crisis. One of Bosnia's main economic challenges in 2010 has been to<br/>

  reduce spending on public sector wages and social benefits to meet<br/>

  the IMF's criteria for obtaining funding for budget shortfalls.<br/>

  Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments<br/>

  bureaus were shut down; foreign banks, primarily from Austria and<br/>

  Italy, now control most of the banking sector. The konvertibilna<br/>

  marka (convertible mark or BAM)- the national currency introduced in<br/>

  1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the<br/>

  banking sector has increased. Bosnia's private sector is growing and<br/>

  foreign investment is slowly increasing, but government spending, at<br/>

  roughly 50% of GDP, remains high because of redundant government<br/>

  offices at the state, entity and municipal level. Privatization of<br/>

  state enterprises, however, has been slow, particularly in the<br/>

  Federation where political division between ethnically-based<br/>

  political parties makes agreement on economic policy more difficult.<br/>

  A sizeable current account deficit and high unemployment rate remain<br/>

  the two most serious macroeconomic problems. Successful<br/>

  implementation of a value-added tax in 2006 provided a predictable<br/>

  source of revenue for the government and helped rein in gray market<br/>

  activity. National-level statistics have also improved over time but<br/>

  a large share of economic activity remains unofficial and<br/>

  unrecorded. Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the<br/>

  Central European Free Trade Agreement in September 2007.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101010">Botswana<br/>

  Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest economic<br/>

  growth rates since independence in 1966, though growth fell below 5%<br/>

  in 2007-08, and turned sharply negative in 2009, with industry<br/>

  falling nearly 30%. Through fiscal discipline and sound management,<br/>

  Botswana transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the<br/>

  world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $13,100 in<br/>

  2010. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit<br/>

  risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and<br/>

  currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export<br/>

  earnings, and about half of the government's revenues. Botswana's<br/>

  heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in<br/>

  the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism, financial services,<br/>

  subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors.<br/>

  Although unemployment was 7.5% in 2007 according to official<br/>

  reports, unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The prevalence<br/>

  of HIV/AIDS is second highest in the world and threatens Botswana's<br/>

  impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in diamond<br/>

  mining production within the next two decades overshadows long-term<br/>

  prospects.<br/>

<p id="id101011">Bouvet Island<br/>

<p id="id101012">Brazil<br/>

  Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural,<br/>

  mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy<br/>

  outweighs that of all other South American countries, and Brazil is<br/>

  expanding its presence in world markets. Since 2003, Brazil has<br/>

  steadily improved its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign<br/>

  reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden<br/>

  toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. In 2008,<br/>

  Brazil became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies<br/>

  awarded investment grade status to its debt. After record growth in<br/>

  2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil<br/>

  in September 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as<br/>

  global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and<br/>

  external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first<br/>

  emerging markets to begin a recovery. Consumer and investor<br/>

  confidence revived and GDP growth returned to positive in 2010,<br/>

  boosted by an export recovery. Brazil's strong growth and high<br/>

  interest rates make it an attractive destination for foreign<br/>

  investors. Large capital inflows over the past year have contributed<br/>

  to the rapid appreciation of its currency and led the government to<br/>

  raise taxes on some foreign investments. President Dilma ROUSSEFF<br/>

  has pledged to retain the previous administration's commitment to<br/>

  inflation targeting by the Central Bank, a floating exchange rate,<br/>

  and fiscal restraint.<br/>

  needed to support the military installation are performed by
  military and contract employees from the UK, Mauritius, the
  Philippines, and the US. There are no industrial or agricultural

<p id="id101014">British Virgin Islands<br/>

  The economy, one of the most stable and<br/>

  prosperous in the Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism<br/>

  generating an estimated 45% of the national income. More than<br/>

  934,000 tourists, mainly from the US, visited the islands in 2008.<br/>

  In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore<br/>

  registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and<br/>

  incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly<br/>

  400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The<br/>

  adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which<br/>

  provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory<br/>

  gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, made the British<br/>

  Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business.<br/>

  Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor<br/>

  soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements.<br/>

  Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the<br/>

  British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since<br/>

  1959.<br/>

  Brunei has a small well-to-do economy that encompasses a<br/>

  mixture of foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government<br/>

  regulation, welfare measures, and village tradition. Crude oil and<br/>

  natural gas production account for just over half of GDP and more<br/>

  than 90% of exports. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia,<br/>

  and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income<br/>

  from domestic production. The government provides for all medical<br/>

  services and free education through the university level and<br/>

  subsidizes rice and housing. A new monetary authority was<br/>

  established in January 2011 with responsibilities that include<br/>

  monetary policy, monitoring of financial institutions, and currency<br/>

  trading activities. Other plans for the future include upgrading the<br/>

  labor force, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and<br/>

  tourist sectors, increasing agricultural production, and, in<br/>

  general, further widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101016">Bulgaria<br/>

  Bulgaria, a former Communist country that entered the EU on<br/>

  1 January 2007, averaged more than 6% growth from 2004 to 2008,<br/>

  driven by significant amounts of foreign direct investment and<br/>

  consumption. Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment<br/>

  to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but the global<br/>

  downturn sharply reduced domestic demand, exports, capital inflows,<br/>

  and industrial production. GDP contracted by approximately 5% in<br/>

  2009, and stagnated in 2010, despite a significant recovery in<br/>

  exports. The economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011, however.<br/>

  Corruption in the public administration, a weak judiciary, and the<br/>

  presence of organized crime remain significant challenges.<br/>

<p id="id101017">Burkina Faso<br/>

  Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that relies<br/>

  heavily on cotton and gold exports for revenue. The country has few<br/>

  natural resources and a weak industrial base. About 90% of the<br/>

  population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is<br/>

  vulnerable to periodic drought. Cotton is the main cash crop. Since<br/>

  1998, Burkina Faso has embarked upon a gradual privatization of<br/>

  state-owned enterprises and in 2004 revised its investment code to<br/>

  attract foreign investment. As a result of this new code and other<br/>

  legislation favoring the mining sector, the country has seen an<br/>

  upswing in gold exploration and production. By 2010, gold had become<br/>

  the main source of export revenue.<br/>

<p id="id101018" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Burma
  Burma, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive
  government controls, inefficient economic policies, corruption, and
  rural poverty. Despite Burma's emergence as a natural gas exporter,
  socio-economic conditions have deteriorated under the regime's
  mismanagement, leaving most of the public in poverty, while military
  leaders and their business cronies exploit the country's ample
  natural resources. The economy suffers from serious macroeconomic
  imbalances - including rising inflation, fiscal deficits, multiple
  official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, a distorted
  interest rate regime, unreliable statistics, and an inability to
  reconcile national accounts to determine a realistic GDP figure.
  Burma's poor investment climate hampers the inflow of foreign
  investment; in recent years, foreign investors have shied away from
  nearly every sector except for natural gas, power generation,
  timber, and mining. The business climate is widely perceived as
  opaque, corrupt, and highly inefficient. Over 60% of the FY 2009-10
  budget is allocated to state owned enterprises - most operating at a
  deficit. The government has recently privatized a number of state
  owned enterprises, but most of the benefits have accrued to regime
  insiders and cronies. The most productive sectors will continue to
  be in extractive industries - especially oil and gas, mining, and
  timber - with the latter two causing significant environmental
  degradation. Other areas, such as manufacturing, tourism and
  services, struggle in the face of inadequate infrastructure,
  unpredictable trade policies, neglected health and education
  systems, and endemic corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003
  caused 20 private banks to close; private banks still operate under
  tight restrictions, limiting the private sector's access to credit.
  The United States, the European Union, Canada, and Australia have
  imposed financial and economic sanctions on Burma, prohibiting most
  financial transactions with Burmese entities, imposing travel bans
  on Burmese officials and others connected to the ruling regime, and
  banning imports of certain Burmese products. These sanctions
  affected the country's fledgling garment industry, isolated the
  struggling banking sector, and raised the costs of doing business
  with Burmese companies, particularly firms tied to Burmese regime
  leaders. The global crisis of 2008-09 caused exports and domestic
  consumer demand to drop. Remittances from overseas Burmese workers -
  who had provided significant financial support for their families -
  slowed or dried up as jobs were lost and migrant workers returned
  home. Though the Burmese government has good economic relations with
  its neighbors, better investment and business climates and an
  improved political situation are needed to promote serious foreign
  investment, exports, and tourism.</p>

<p id="id101019">Burundi<br/>

  Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an<br/>

  underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly<br/>

  agricultural which accounts for about 35% of GDP and employs more<br/>

  than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and<br/>

  tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though<br/>

  exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Burundi's export<br/>

  earning - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on<br/>

  weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The<br/>

  Tutsi minority, 14% of the population, dominates the coffee trade.<br/>

  An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more<br/>

  than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania,<br/>

  and displaced 140,000 others internally. Only one in two children go<br/>

  to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food,<br/>

  medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Burundi's GDP grew<br/>

  around 4% annually in 2006-09. Political stability and the end of<br/>

  the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has<br/>

  increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor<br/>

  education rates, a weak legal system, and low administrative<br/>

  capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. Burundi will<br/>

  continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and<br/>

  multilateral donors; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal<br/>

  cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government's revenues and its<br/>

  ability to pay salaries. Burundi joined the East African Community,<br/>

  which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and received $700<br/>

  million in debt relief in 2009. Instability spilling over from<br/>

  eastern Congo-Kinshasa and the ban on minerals smuggled across<br/>

  Burundi's border will be the main challenges to economic growth.<br/>

<p id="id101020" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Cambodia
  From 2004 to 2007, the economy grew about 10% per year,
  driven largely by an expansion in the garment sector, construction,
  agriculture, and tourism. GDP contracted 1.5% in 2009 as a result of
  the global economic slowdown, but climbed more than 4% in 1010,
  driven by renewed exports. With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO
  Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, Cambodian textile producers were
  forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as
  China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The garment industry
  currently employs more than 280,000 people - about 5% of the work
  force - and contributes more than 70% of Cambodia's exports. In
  2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's
  territorial waters, representing a new revenue stream for the
  government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is
  attracting significant investor interest, particularly in the
  northern parts of the country. The government has said opportunities
  exist for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. In 2006, a
  US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
  (TIFA) was signed, and several rounds of discussions have been held
  since 2007. Rubber exports increased about 25% in 2009 due to rising
  global demand. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly,
  with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007-08,
  however, economic troubles abroad dampened growth in 2009. The
  global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports,
  and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit. The
  long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge.
  The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral
  donors, including the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's
  many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over
  the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which
  the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's
  demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than
  25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills,
  particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from
  an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.</p>

<p id="id101021">Cameroon<br/>

  Because of its modest oil resources and favorable<br/>

  agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed<br/>

  primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces<br/>

  many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,<br/>

  such as stagnate per capita income, a relatively inequitable<br/>

  distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally<br/>

  unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the<br/>

  government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs<br/>

  designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in<br/>

  agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The<br/>

  IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget<br/>

  transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. Weak<br/>

  prices for oil and cocoa led to the significant slowdown in growth<br/>

  in 2009. The government is under pressure to reduce its budget<br/>

  deficit, which by the government's own forecast will hit 2.8% of<br/>

  GDP, but the presidential election in 2011 may make fiscal austerity<br/>

  difficult.<br/>

<p id="id101022">Canada<br/>

  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society in the<br/>

  trillion-dollar class, Canada resembles the US in its<br/>

  market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and affluent<br/>

  living standards. Since World War II, the impressive growth of the<br/>

  manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the<br/>

  nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial<br/>

  and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the<br/>

  1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes<br/>

  Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic<br/>

  integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada<br/>

  enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about<br/>

  three-fourths of Canadian exports each year. Canada is the US's<br/>

  largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and<br/>

  electric power. Given its great natural resources, skilled labor<br/>

  force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic<br/>

  growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic<br/>

  crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final<br/>

  months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009<br/>

  after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged<br/>

  from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the<br/>

  world, owing to the country's tradition of conservative lending<br/>

  practices and strong capitalization. During 2010, Canada's economy<br/>

  grew only 3%, because of weak exports.<br/>

  long-term drought and poor soil for agriculture on several of the<br/>

  islands. The economy is service oriented with commerce, transport,<br/>

  tourism, and public services accounting for about three-fourths of<br/>

  GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the<br/>

  share of food production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be<br/>

  imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not<br/>

  fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit<br/>

  financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of<br/>

  emigrants; remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%. Despite the<br/>

  lack of resources, sound economic management has produced steadily<br/>

  improving incomes. Continued economic reforms are aimed at<br/>

  developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to<br/>

  diversify the economy. Future prospects depend heavily on the<br/>

  maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances,<br/>

  and the momentum of the government's development program. Cape Verde<br/>

  became a member of the WTO in July 2008.<br/>

<p id="id101024">Cayman Islands<br/>

  With no direct taxation, the islands are a thriving<br/>

  offshore financial center. More than 93,000 companies were<br/>

  registered in the Cayman Islands as of 2008, including almost 300<br/>

  banks, 800 insurers, and 10,000 mutual funds. A stock exchange was<br/>

  opened in 1997. Tourism is also a mainstay, accounting for about 70%<br/>

  of GDP and 75% of foreign currency earnings. The tourist industry is<br/>

  aimed at the luxury market and caters mainly to visitors from North<br/>

  America. Total tourist arrivals exceeded 1.9 million in 2008, with<br/>

  about half from the US. About 90% of the islands' food and consumer<br/>

  goods must be imported. The Caymanians enjoy one of the highest<br/>

  outputs per capita and one of the highest standards of living in the<br/>

  world.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101025">Central African Republic<br/>

  Subsistence agriculture, together with<br/>

  forestry, remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African<br/>

  Republic (CAR), with about 60% of the population living in outlying<br/>

  areas. The agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP.<br/>

  Timber has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the<br/>

  diamond industry, for 40%. Important constraints to economic<br/>

  development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor<br/>

  transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy<br/>

  of misdirected macroeconomic policies. Factional fighting between<br/>

  the government and its opponents remains a drag on economic<br/>

  revitalization. Distribution of income is extraordinarily unequal.<br/>

  Grants from France and the international community can only<br/>

  partially meet humanitarian needs.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101026">Chad<br/>

  Chad's primarily agricultural economy will continue to be<br/>

  boosted by major foreign direct investment projects in the oil<br/>

  sector that began in 2000. At least 80% of Chad's population relies<br/>

  on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood.<br/>

  Chad's economy has long been handicapped by its landlocked position,<br/>

  high energy costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on<br/>

  foreign assistance and foreign capital for most public and private<br/>

  sector investment projects. A consortium led by two US companies has<br/>

  been investing $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1<br/>

  billion barrels - in southern Chad. Chinese companies are also<br/>

  expanding exploration efforts and are currently building a 300-km<br/>

  pipleline and the country's first refinery. The nation's total oil<br/>

  reserves are estimated at 1.5 billion barrels. Oil production came<br/>

  on stream in late 2003. Chad began to export oil in 2004. Cotton,<br/>

  cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export<br/>

  earnings.<br/>

<p id="id101027" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Chile
  Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high
  level of foreign trade and a reputation for strong financial
  institutions and sound policy that have given it the strongest
  sovereign bond rating in South America. Exports account for more
  than one-fourth of GDP, with commodities making up some
  three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides one-third of
  government revenue. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a
  role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic
  government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in
  1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military
  government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97, but fell
  to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies
  implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because
  of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global
  financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the situation in
  1999, reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and
  electricity rationing, and Chile experienced negative economic
  growth for the first time in more than 15 years. In the years since
  then, growth has averaged 4% per year. Chile deepened its
  longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of
  a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January
  2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or regional trade
  agreements than any other country. It has 57 such agreements (not
  all of them full free trade agreements), including with the European
  Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. Over the
  past seven years, foreign direct investment inflows have quadrupled
  to some $15 billion in 2010, but FDI had dropped to about $7 billion
  in 2009 in the face of diminished investment throughout the world.
  The Chilean government conducts a rule-based countercyclical fiscal
  policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during
  periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and allowing
  deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and
  growth. As of September 2008, those sovereign wealth funds - kept
  mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves -
  amounted to more than $20 billion. Chile used $4 billion from this
  fund to finance a fiscal stimulus package to fend off recession. In
  December 2009, the OECD invited Chile to become a full member, after
  a two year period of compliance with organization mandates. The
  economy started to show signs of a rebound in the fourth quarter,
  2009, and GDP grew more than 5% in 2010. The magnitude 8.8
  earthquake that struck Chile in February 2010 was one of the top ten
  strongest earthquakes on record. It caused considerable damage near
  the epicenter, located about 70 miles from Concepcion - and about
  200 miles southwest of Santiago.</p>

<p id="id101028" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">China
  China's economy since the late 1970s has changed from a
  closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that
  plays a major role in the global economy - in 2010 China became the
  world's largest exporter. Reforms began with the phasing out of
  collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual
  liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased
  autonomy for state enterprises, creation of a diversified banking
  system, development of stock markets, rapid growth of the private
  sector, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China generally
  has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion. In recent years,
  China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors
  it considers important to "economic security," explicitly looking to
  foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its
  currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years, in July 2005
  China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved
  to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies.
  From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi
  against the US dollar was more than 20%, but the exchange rate
  remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global
  financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing allowed resumption of
  a gradual appreciation. The restructuring of the economy and
  resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold
  increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity
  (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2010 stood
  as the second-largest economy in the world after the US, having
  surpassed Japan in 2001. The dollar values of China's agricultural
  and industrial output each exceeded those of the US, although China
  was second to the US in the value of services it produced. Still,
  per capita income is below the world average. The Chinese government
  faces numerous economic development challenges, including: (a)
  reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low
  domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of
  millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force; (c)
  reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing
  environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's
  rapid transformation. Economic development has progressed further in
  coastal provinces than in the interior, and approximately 200
  million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban
  areas to find work. One demographic consequence of the "one child"
  policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries
  in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air
  pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table,
  especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China
  continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic
  development. The Chinese government is seeking to add energy
  production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing
  on nuclear and alternative energy development. In 2009, the global
  economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the
  first time in many years, but China rebounded quickly, outperforming
  all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10%. The
  economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011,
  lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out
  during the global financial crisis. The government vows to continue
  reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic
  consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports
  for GDP growth in the future, but China likely will make only
  marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two
  economic problems China currently faces are inflation - which, late
  in 2010, surpassed the government's target of 3% - and local
  government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and
  is largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality.</p>

  Phosphate mining had been the only significant<br/>

  economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian government<br/>

  closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened. With the support of<br/>

  the government, a $34 million casino opened in 1993, but closed in<br/>

  Although 115 species of fish have been identified<br/>

  in the territorial waters of Clipperton Island, the only economic<br/>

  activity is tuna fishing.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101031">Cocos (Keeling) Islands<br/>

  Coconuts, grown throughout the islands, are<br/>

  the sole cash crop. Small local gardens and fishing contribute to<br/>

  the food supply, but additional food and most other necessities must<br/>

  be imported from Australia. There is a small tourist industry.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101032">Colombia<br/>

  Colombia experienced accelerating growth between 2002 and<br/>

  2007, chiefly due to improvements in domestic security, rising<br/>

  commodity prices, and to President URIBE's promarket economic<br/>

  policies. Foreign direct investment reached a record $10 billion in<br/>

  2008, and continues to flow in, especially in the oil sector. A<br/>

  series of policies enhanced Colombia's investment climate:<br/>

  pro-business reforms in the oil and gas sectors and export-led<br/>

  growth fueled mainly by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug<br/>

  Eradication Act. Inequality, underemployment, and narcotrafficking<br/>

  remain significant challenges, and Colombia's infrastructure<br/>

  requires major improvements to sustain economic expansion. Because<br/>

  of the global financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia's<br/>

  exports, Colombia's economy grew only 2.7% in 2008, and 0.8% in 2009<br/>

  but rebounded to around 4.5% in 2010. The government has encouraged<br/>

  exporters to diversify their customer base beyond the United States<br/>

  and Venezuela, traditionally Colombia's largest trading partners;<br/>

  the SANTOS administration continues to pursue free trade agreements<br/>

  with Asian and South American partners and awaits the approval of a<br/>

  Canadian trade accord by Canada's and EU's parliaments. The business<br/>

  sector remains concerned about Venezuela's trade restrictions on<br/>

  Colombian exports, an appreciating domestic currency, and the<br/>

  pending US Congressional approval of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion<br/>

  Agreement.<br/>

<p id="id101033">Comoros<br/>

  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of<br/>

  three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young and<br/>

  rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low<br/>

  educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence<br/>

  level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy<br/>

  dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,<br/>

  including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP,<br/>

  employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.<br/>

  Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla,<br/>

  cloves, and ylang-ylang and Comoros' export earnings are easily<br/>

  disrupted by disasters such as fires. The country is not<br/>

  self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts<br/>

  for the bulk of imports. The government - which is hampered by<br/>

  internal political disputes - lacks a comprehensive strategy to<br/>

  attract foreign investment and is struggling to upgrade education<br/>

  and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial<br/>

  enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote<br/>

  tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Political<br/>

  problems have inhibited growth, which has averaged only about 1% in<br/>

  2006-09. Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement<br/>

  GDP. In September 2009 the IMF approved Comoros for a three-year $21<br/>

  million loan. The IMF gave generally positive reports of the<br/>

  country's program performance as of October 2010. The African<br/>

  Development Bank approved a $34.6 million debt-relief package loan<br/>

  for Comoros in September 2010, and Comoros will attempt to qualifry<br/>

  for debt relief in 2012 under the IMF and World Bank's Heavily<br/>

  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.<br/>
