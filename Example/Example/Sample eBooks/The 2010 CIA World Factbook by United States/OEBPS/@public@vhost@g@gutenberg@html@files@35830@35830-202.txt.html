  The economy of the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo - a nation endowed with vast potential wealth
  - is slowly recovering from decades of decline. Systemic corruption
  since independence in 1960 and conflict that began in May 1997 has
  dramatically reduced national output and government revenue,
  increased external debt, and resulted in the deaths of more than 5
  million people from violence, famine, and disease. Foreign
  businesses curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome
  of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating
  environment. Conditions began to improve in late 2002 with the
  withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. The
  transitional government reopened relations with international
  financial institutions and international donors, and President
  KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress has been slow and the
  International Monetary Fund curtailed their program for the DRC at
  the end of March 2006 because of fiscal overruns. Much economic
  activity still occurs in the informal sector, and is not reflected
  in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of
  most export income, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP
  growth from 2006-2008, however, the government's review of mining
  contracts that began in 2006, combined with a fall in world market
  prices for the DRC's key mineral exports temporarily weakened output
  in 2009, leading to a balance of payments crisis. The recovery in
  mineral prices beginning in mid 2009 boosted mineral exports, and
  emergency funds from the IMF boosted foreign reserves. An uncertain
  legal framework, corruption, a lack of transparency in government
  policy are long-term problems for the mining sector and the economy
  as a whole. The global recession cut economic growth in 2009 to less
  than half its 2008 level, but growth returned to 3% in 2010. The DRC
  signed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF in 2009
  and received $12 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief
  in 2010.</p>

<p id="id101035">Congo, Republic of the<br/>

  The economy is a mixture of subsistence<br/>

  agriculture, an industrial sector based largely on oil and support<br/>

  services, and government spending. Oil has supplanted forestry as<br/>

  the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government<br/>

  revenues and exports. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil<br/>

  revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development<br/>

  projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest<br/>

  rates in Africa. Characterized by budget problems and overstaffing,<br/>

  the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil<br/>

  earnings through oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing<br/>

  debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts<br/>

  have been undertaken with the support of international<br/>

  organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. However, the<br/>

  reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted.<br/>

  Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who returned to power when the war ended in<br/>

  October 1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on<br/>

  economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with<br/>

  international financial institutions. Economic progress was badly<br/>

  hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in<br/>

  December 1998, which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The<br/>

  current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and<br/>

  faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and<br/>

  reducing poverty. The drop in oil prices during the global crisis<br/>

  reduced oil revenue by about 30%, but the subsequent recovery of oil<br/>

  prices has boosted the economy's GDP and near-term prospects. In<br/>

  March 2006, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)<br/>

  approved Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo,<br/>

  receiving $1.9 billion in debt relief under the program in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101036">Cook Islands<br/>

  Like many other South Pacific island nations, the Cook<br/>

  Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the<br/>

  country from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets,<br/>

  lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural<br/>

  disasters, and inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture, employing<br/>

  more than one-quarter of the working population, provides the<br/>

  economic base with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit.<br/>

  Black pearls are the Cook Islands' leading export. Manufacturing<br/>

  activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and<br/>

  handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants<br/>

  and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and<br/>

  1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated<br/>

  public service and accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent<br/>

  reforms, including the sale of state assets, the strengthening of<br/>

  economic management, the encouragement of tourism, and a debt<br/>

  restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment and growth.<br/>

<p id="id101038" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Costa Rica
  Prior to the global economic crisis, Costa Rica enjoyed
  stable economic growth. The economy contracted 0.7% in 2009, but
  resumed growth at more than 3% in 2010. While the traditional
  agricultural exports of bananas, coffee, sugar, and beef are still
  the backbone of commodity export trade, a variety of industrial and
  specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in
  recent years. High value added goods and services, including
  microchips, have further bolstered exports. Tourism continues to
  bring in foreign exchange, as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity
  makes it a key destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain
  attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high
  education levels, as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the
  free-trade zones; and Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest
  levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America.
  However, many business impediments, such as high levels of
  bureaucracy, difficulty of enforcing contracts, and weak investor
  protection, remain. Poverty has remained around 15-20% for nearly 20
  years, and the strong social safety net that had been put into place
  by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints
  on government expenditures. Unlike the rest of Central America,
  Costa Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only
  represent about 2% of GDP. Immigration from Nicaragua has
  increasingly become a concern for the government. The estimated
  300,000-500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are
  an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor, but also place
  heavy demands on the social welfare system. The US-Central
  American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered
  into force on 1 January 2009, after significant delays within the
  Costa Rican legislature. CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased
  foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy, including
  the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to
  private investors. President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal
  reform in the coming year, seeking to boost revenue, possibly
  through revised tax legislation, to fund an increase in security
  services and education.</p>

<p id="id101039">Cote d'Ivoire<br/>

  Cote d'Ivoire is heavily dependent on agriculture and<br/>

  related activities, which engage roughly 68% of the population. Cote<br/>

  d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans<br/>

  and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil.<br/>

  Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in<br/>

  international prices for these products, and, to a lesser extent, in<br/>

  climatic conditions. Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top<br/>

  export revenue earners, but the country is also producing gold.<br/>

  Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political turmoil has<br/>

  continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss of foreign<br/>

  investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by more than 2% in<br/>

  2008 and around 4% per year in 2009-10. Per capita income has<br/>

  declined by 15% since 1999, but registered a slight improvement in<br/>

  2009-10. Power cuts caused by a turbine failure in early 2010 slowed<br/>

  economic activity. Cote d'Ivoire in 2010 signed agreements to<br/>

  restructure its Paris Club bilateral, other bilateral, and London<br/>

  Club debt. Cote d'Ivoire's long term challenges include political<br/>

  instability and degrading infrastructure.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101040">Croatia<br/>

  Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics,<br/>

  Croatia's economy suffered badly during the 1991-95 war as output<br/>

  collapsed and the country missed the early waves of investment in<br/>

  Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin<br/>

  Wall. Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes<br/>

  began to improve slowly, with moderate but steady GDP growth between<br/>

  4% and 6% led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer<br/>

  spending. Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the<br/>

  currency, the kuna, stable. Nevertheless, difficult problems still<br/>

  remain, including a stubbornly high unemployment rate, a growing<br/>

  trade deficit and uneven regional development. The state retains a<br/>

  large role in the economy, as privatization efforts often meet stiff<br/>

  public and political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization<br/>

  has largely been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep<br/>

  resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from<br/>

  politicians. The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and<br/>

  structural reform. While long term growth prospects for the economy<br/>

  remain strong, Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of<br/>

  the global financial crisis. Croatia's high foreign debt, anemic<br/>

  export sector, strained state budget, and over-reliance on tourism<br/>

  revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the<br/>

  medium term.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101041">Cuba<br/>

  The government continues to balance the need for economic<br/>

  loosening against a desire for firm political control. The<br/>

  government announced it would eliminate 500,000 state jobs by March<br/>

  2011 and has expanded opportunities for self-employment. President<br/>

  CASTRO said such changes were needed to update the economic model to<br/>

  ensure the survival of socialism. It has rolled back limited reforms<br/>

  undertaken in the 1990s to increase enterprise efficiency and<br/>

  alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services.<br/>

  The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than<br/>

  before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused by the loss of<br/>

  Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. Since late 2000, Venezuela<br/>

  has been providing oil on preferential terms, and it currently<br/>

  supplies about 100,000 barrels per day of petroleum products. Cuba<br/>

  has been paying for the oil, in part, with the services of Cuban<br/>

  personnel in Venezuela including some 30,000 medical professionals.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101042">Curacao<br/>

  Tourism, petroleum refining, and offshore finance are the<br/>

  mainstays of this small economy, which is closely tied to the<br/>

  outside world. Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade,<br/>

  the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed<br/>

  infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. Curacao<br/>

  has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil<br/>

  tankers. The Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery<br/>

  on the island from the government; most of the oil for the refinery<br/>

  is imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are<br/>

  exported to the US. Almost all consumer and capital goods are<br/>

  imported, with the US, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico being the major<br/>

  suppliers. The government is attempting to diversify its industry<br/>

  and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to<br/>

  expand business there. Poor soils and inadequate water supplies<br/>

  hamper the development of agriculture. Budgetary problems complicate<br/>

  reform of the health and pension systems for an aging population.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101043">Cyprus<br/>

  The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control<br/>

  has a market economy dominated by the service sector, which accounts<br/>

  for nearly four-fifths of GDP. Tourism, financial services, and real<br/>

  estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the<br/>

  past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, which often<br/>

  fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic<br/>

  conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area<br/>

  under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU<br/>

  average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate<br/>

  Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national<br/>

  currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the<br/>

  preceding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a<br/>

  soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in<br/>

  2008, and reduced inflation to 4.7%. This prosperity came under<br/>

  pressure in 2009, as construction and tourism slowed in the face of<br/>

  reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial<br/>

  crisis. Although Cyprus lagged its EU peers in showing signs of<br/>

  stress from the global crisis, the economy tipped into recession in<br/>

  mid 2009 and contracted 1.8% for the year. In addition, the budget<br/>

  deficit is on the rise and reached 5.7% of GDP in 2010, a violation<br/>

  of the EU's budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP. In<br/>

  response to the country's deteriorating finances, Nicosia is<br/>

  promising to implement measures to cut the cost of the state<br/>

  payroll, curb tax evasion, and revamp social benefits. However, it<br/>

  has been slow to act, lacking a consensus in parliament and among<br/>

  the social partners for its proposed measures.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101044">Czech Republic<br/>

  The Czech Republic is one of the most stable and<br/>

  prosperous of the post-Communist states of Central and Eastern<br/>

  Europe. Maintaining an open investment climate has been a key<br/>

  element of the Czech Republic's transition from a communist,<br/>

  centrally planned economy to a functioning market economy. As a<br/>

  member of the European Union, with an advantageous location in the<br/>

  center of Europe, a relatively low cost structure, and a<br/>

  well-qualified labor force, the Czech Republic is an attractive<br/>

  destination for foreign investment. Prior to its EU accession in<br/>

  2004, the Czech government harmonized its laws and regulations with<br/>

  those of the European Union. The small, open, export-driven Czech<br/>

  economy grew by over 6% annually from 2005-2007 and by 2.5% in 2008.<br/>

  The conservative Czech financial system has remained relatively<br/>

  healthy throughout 2009. Nevertheless, the real economy contracted<br/>

  by 4.1% in 2009, mainly due to a significant drop in external demand<br/>

  as the Czech Republic's main export markets fell into recession. GDP<br/>

  is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2010, driven largely by a rebound in<br/>

  external demand, particularly from Gremany.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101045">Denmark<br/>

  This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech<br/>

  agricultural sector, state-of-the-art industry with world-leading<br/>

  firms in pharmaceuticals, maritime shipping and renewable energy,<br/>

  and a high dependence on foreign trade. The Danish economy is also<br/>

  characterized by extensive government welfare measures, an equitable<br/>

  distribution of income, and comfortable living standards. Denmark is<br/>

  a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance<br/>

  of payments surplus. After a long consumption-driven upswing,<br/>

  Denmark's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing<br/>

  boom. Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008-09. The global<br/>

  financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through<br/>

  increased borrowing costs and lower export demand, consumer<br/>

  confidence, and investment. The global financial crises cut Danish<br/>

  GDP by 0.9% in 2008 and 4.7% in 2009. Historically low levels of<br/>

  unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5%,<br/>

  about half the level of the EU. Denmark made a modest recovery in<br/>

  2010 in part because of increased government spending. An impending<br/>

  decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major<br/>

  long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for<br/>

  many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit<br/>

  during 2009-10. Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among<br/>

  the strongest in the EU. Despite previously meeting the criteria to<br/>

  join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark<br/>

  has decided not to join, although the Danish krone remains pegged to<br/>

  the euro.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101046">Dhekelia<br/>

  Economic activity is limited to providing services to the<br/>

  military and their families located in Dhekelia. All food and<br/>

  manufactured goods must be imported.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101047">Djibouti<br/>

  The economy is based on service activities connected with<br/>

  the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in<br/>

  the Horn of Africa. Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the<br/>

  capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty<br/>

  rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most<br/>

  food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit<br/>

  port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling<br/>

  center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia<br/>

  represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal.<br/>

  Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation<br/>

  is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help<br/>

  support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.<br/>

  An unemployment rate of nearly 60% in urban areas continues to be a<br/>

  major problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed<br/>

  tie of the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high<br/>

  value of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance<br/>

  of payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% between<br/>

  1999 and 2006 because of recession, civil war, and a high population<br/>

  growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Djibouti has<br/>

  experienced relatively minimal impact from the global economic<br/>

  downturn, but its reliance on diesel-generated electricity and<br/>

  imported food leave average consumers vulnerable to global price<br/>

  shocks.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101048">Dominica<br/>

  The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture -<br/>

  primarily bananas - in years past, but increasingly has been driven<br/>

  by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an<br/>

  "ecotourism" destination. In order to diversify the island's<br/>

  production base, the government also is attempting to develop an<br/>

  offshore financial sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to<br/>

  develop geothermal energy resources. In 2003, the government began a<br/>

  comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including elimination<br/>

  of price controls, privatization of the state banana company, and<br/>

  tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to<br/>

  meet IMF requirements. This restructuring paved the way for an<br/>

  economic recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high -<br/>

  and helped to reduce the debt burden, which remains at about 85% of<br/>

  GDP. Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages<br/>

  equivalent to 20% of GDP. In 2009, growth slowed as a result of the<br/>

  global recession; it picked up only slightly in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101049">Dominican Republic<br/>

  The Dominican Republic has long been viewed<br/>

  primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, but in<br/>

  recent years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the<br/>

  economy's largest employer, due to growth in tourism and free trade<br/>

  zones. The economy is highly dependent upon the US, the destination<br/>

  for nearly 60% of exports. Remittances from the US amount to about a<br/>

  tenth of GDP, equivalent to almost half of exports and<br/>

  three-quarters of tourism receipts. The country suffers from marked<br/>

  income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less<br/>

  than one-fifth of GDP, while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of<br/>

  GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains an important<br/>

  long-term challenge. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free<br/>

  Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007, boosting<br/>

  investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian garment<br/>

  industry. The growth of the Dominican Republic's economy slowed in<br/>

  2008-09 because of the global recession, but still remained one of<br/>

  the fastest growing in the region.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101050">Ecuador<br/>

  Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum<br/>

  resources, which have accounted for more than half of the country's<br/>

  export earnings and one-fourth of public sector revenues in recent<br/>

  years. In 1999/2000, Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis, with<br/>

  GDP contracting by more than 6%. Poverty increased significantly,<br/>

  the banking system collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its external<br/>

  debt later that year. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series<br/>

  of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US<br/>

  dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and<br/>

  positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high<br/>

  oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From<br/>

  2002-06 the economy grew 5.5%, the highest five-year average in 25<br/>

  years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth<br/>

  rate of 7.2% in 2008, in large part due to high global petroleum<br/>

  prices. President Rafael CORREA, who took office in January 2007,<br/>

  defaulted on Ecuador's sovereign debt in December 2008, refusing to<br/>

  make payment on $3.2 billion in international bonds, representing<br/>

  over 80% of Ecuador's private external debt. Economic policies under<br/>

  the CORREA administration - including an announcement in late 2009<br/>

  terminating 13 bilateral investment treaties - have generated<br/>

  economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment. The<br/>

  Ecuadorian economy slowed to 0.4% growth in 2009 due to the global<br/>

  financial crisis, and the sharp decline in world oil prices and<br/>

  remittance flows, but picked up to a 2.4% growth rate in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101051">Egypt<br/>

  Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt<br/>

  is bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic<br/>

  activity takes place. Egypt's economy was highly centralized during<br/>

  the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but has opened up<br/>

  considerably under former President Anwar EL-SADAT and current<br/>

  President Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo from 2004 to 2008<br/>

  aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment<br/>

  and facilitate GDP growth. The global financial crisis has slowed<br/>

  the reform efforts. The budget deficit climbed to over 8% of GDP and<br/>

  Egypt's GDP growth slowed to 4.6% in 2009, predominately due to<br/>

  reduced growth in export-oriented sectors, including manufacturing<br/>

  and tourism, and Suez Canal revenues. In 2010, the government spent<br/>

  more on infrastructure and public projects, and exports drove GDP<br/>

  growth to more than 5%, but GDP growth in 2011 is unlikely to bounce<br/>

  back to pre-global financial recession levels, when it stood at 7%.<br/>

  Despite the relatively high levels of economic growth over the past<br/>

  few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remain poor.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101052">El Salvador<br/>

  Despite being the smallest country geographically in<br/>

  Central America, El Salvador has the third largest economy in the<br/>

  region. The economy took a hit from the global recession and real<br/>

  GDP contracted by 3.5% in 2009. The economy began a slow recovery in<br/>

  2010 on the back of improved export and remittances figures.<br/>

  Remittances accounted for 16% of GDP in 2009, and about a third of<br/>

  all households receive these transfers. In 2006 El Salvador was the<br/>

  first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free<br/>

  Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has bolstered the export of<br/>

  processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the<br/>

  apparel sector amid increased Asian competition and the expiration<br/>

  of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. El Salvador has promoted an<br/>

  open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of<br/>

  privatizations extending to telecom, electricity distribution,<br/>

  banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the<br/>

  Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million<br/>

  compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the<br/>

  country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the<br/>

  civil war, through investments in education, public services,<br/>

  enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the<br/>

  adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost<br/>

  control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response<br/>

  to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained<br/>

  by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any<br/>

  international financing.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101053">Equatorial Guinea<br/>

  The discovery and exploitation of large oil<br/>

  reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth but<br/>

  fluctuating oil prices have produced huge swings in GDP growth in<br/>

  recent years. Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major<br/>

  components of GDP. Subsistence farming is the dominate form of<br/>

  livelihood. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on<br/>

  cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the<br/>

  rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for<br/>

  agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its intention to<br/>

  reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number of aid<br/>

  programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off<br/>

  since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. Government<br/>

  officials and their family members own most businesses, but<br/>

  corruption is rampant. Undeveloped natural resources include<br/>

  titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Growth<br/>

  remained strong in 2008, led by oil, but dropped in 2009-10, as the<br/>

  price of oil fell.<br/>

<p id="id101054">Eritrea<br/>

  Since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has faced<br/>

  the economic problems of a small, desperately poor country,<br/>

  accentuated by the recent implementation of restrictive economic<br/>

  policies. Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the<br/>

  sole political party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice<br/>

  (PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations, a large share of<br/>

  the population - nearly 80% - is engaged in subsistence agriculture,<br/>

  but they produce only a small share of total output. Since the<br/>

  conclusion of the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 2000, the government has<br/>

  maintained a firm grip on the economy, expanding the use of the<br/>

  military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's<br/>

  development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of<br/>

  foreign currency by limiting access and availability. Few private<br/>

  enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy depends heavily on<br/>

  taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall and the<br/>

  delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military<br/>

  continue to interfere with agricultural production, and Eritrea's<br/>

  recent harvests have been unable to meet the food needs of the<br/>

  country. The Government continues to place its hope for additional<br/>

  revenue on the development of several international mining projects.<br/>

  Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the<br/>

  Eritrean Government, a Canadian mining company signed a contract<br/>

  with the government in 2007 and began mineral extraction in 2010.<br/>

  Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master social<br/>

  problems such as illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills, and more<br/>

  importantly, on the government's willingness to support a true<br/>

  market economy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101055">Estonia<br/>

  Estonia, a 2004 European Union entrant, has a modern<br/>

  market-based economy and one of the higher per capita income levels<br/>

  in Central Europe and the Baltic region. Estonia's successive<br/>

  governments have pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda<br/>

  and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms.<br/>

  The current government has pursued relatively sound fiscal policies<br/>

  that have resulted in balanced budgets and very low public debt. The<br/>

  economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications<br/>

  sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, and Germany.<br/>

  Tallinn's priority has been to sustain high growth rates - on<br/>

  average 8% per year from 2003 to 2007. Estonia's economy slowed down<br/>

  markedly and fell sharply into recession in mid-2008, primarily as a<br/>

  result of an investment and consumption slump following the bursting<br/>

  of the real estate market bubble. GDP dropped nearly 15% in 2009,<br/>

  among the world's highest rates of contraction. A modest recovery<br/>

  began in 2010, but unemployment stands above 13%. Estonia adopted<br/>

  the euro in January 2011.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101056">Ethiopia<br/>

  Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on<br/>

  agriculture, accounting for almost 45% of GDP, and 85% of total<br/>

  employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought<br/>

  and poor cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian<br/>

  economy with exports of some $350 million in 2006, but historically<br/>

  low prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement<br/>

  income. Under Ethiopia's constitution, the state owns all land and<br/>

  provides long-term leases to the tenants; the system continues to<br/>

  hamper growth in the industrial sector as entrepreneurs are unable<br/>

  to use land as collateral for loans. In November 2001, Ethiopia<br/>

  qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries<br/>

  (HIPC) initiative, and in December 2005 the IMF forgave Ethiopia's<br/>

  debt. The global economic downturn led to balance of payments<br/>

  pressures, partially alleviated by recent emergency funding from the<br/>

  IMF. While GDP growth has remained high, per capita inome is among<br/>

  the lowest in the world.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101057">European Union<br/>

  Internally, the EU has abolished trade barriers,<br/>

  adopted a common currency, and is striving toward convergence of<br/>

  living standards. Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's<br/>

  trade position and its political and economic power. Because of the<br/>

  great differences in per capita income among member states (from<br/>

  $7,000 to $78,000) and in national attitudes toward issues like<br/>

  inflation, debt, and foreign trade, the EU faces difficulties in<br/>

  devising and enforcing common policies. In the wake of the global<br/>

  economic crisis, the European Commission projected that the EU's<br/>

  economy would shrink by 4% in 2009 and 0.1% in 2010. The EU has<br/>

  recovered from the crisis faster than expected, however, and the<br/>

  Commission estimates 2010 growth at 1.8%. Significant risks to<br/>

  growth nevertheless remain, including, high official debts and<br/>

  deficits, aging populations, over-regulation of non-financial<br/>

  businesses, and doubts about the sustainability of European Economic<br/>

  and Monetary Union (EMU). In June 2010, prompted by the Greek<br/>

  financial crisis, the EU and the IMF set up a $1 trillion bailout<br/>

  fund to rescue any EMU member in danger of default, but it has not<br/>

  calmed market jitters that have diminished the value of the euro.<br/>

  Eleven established EU member states introduced the euro as their<br/>

  common currency on 1 January 1999 (Greece did so two years later),<br/>

  but the UK and Denmark have 'opt-outs' that allow them to keep their<br/>

  national currencies, and Sweden has not taken the steps needed to<br/>

  participate. Between 2004 and 2007, the EU admitted 12 countries<br/>

  that are, in general, less advanced economically than the other 15.<br/>

  Of the 12 most recent member states, only Slovenia (1 January 2007),<br/>

  Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), and<br/>

  Estonia (1 January 2011) have adopted the euro; the remaining states<br/>

  other than the UK and Denmark are legally required to adopt the<br/>

  currency upon meeting EU's fiscal and monetary convergence criteria.<br/>

<p id="id101058" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
  The economy was formerly based on
  agriculture, mainly sheep farming, but today fishing contributes the
  bulk of economic activity. In 1987, the government began selling
  fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland
  Islands' exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than
  $40 million per year, which help support the island's health,
  education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish
  taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish
  winter fodder. Foreign exchange earnings come from shipments of
  high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.
  The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
  Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around
  the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial
  reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date, no
  exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina
  and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty
  conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential
  oil reserves. Political tensions between the UK and Argentina rose
  in early 2010 after a UK company began oil drilling activities in
  the waters around the Falkland Islands but abated somewhat when the
  drilling operation failed to discover commercially exploitable oil
  reserves. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is increasing rapidly,
  with about 30,000 visitors in 2001. Another large source of income
  is interest paid on money the government has in the bank. The
  British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost.</p>

<p id="id101059">Faroe Islands<br/>

  The Faroese economy is dependent on fishing, which<br/>

  makes the economy vulnerable to price swings. The sector accounts<br/>

  for about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the<br/>

  Faroese economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and<br/>

  historically high oil prices that continue to trouble the economy.<br/>

  Though oil prices have come down, reduced catches, especially of cod<br/>

  and haddock, have continued to strain the Faroese economy. GDP grew<br/>

  0.5% in 2008-09. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a<br/>

  strong performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates<br/>

  averaging close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings<br/>

  and salmon farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its<br/>

  lowest level in the first half of 2008, but increased to 3.9% in<br/>

  2009 and is rising. The Faroese Home Rule Government produced<br/>

  increasing budget surpluses that helped to reduce the large public<br/>

  debt, most of it to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing<br/>

  and salmon farming make the Faroese economy very vulnerable to<br/>

  fluctuations in world demand. In addition, budget surpluses turned<br/>

  to deficits in 2008-09, and the economy at both the country and<br/>

  local level is running large deficits. Initial discoveries of oil in<br/>

  the Faroese area give hope for eventual oil production, which may<br/>

  provide a foundation for a more diversified economy and less<br/>

  dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy<br/>

  from Denmark amounting to about 6% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have<br/>

  a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101060">Fiji<br/>

  Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one<br/>

  of the most developed of the Pacific island economies though still<br/>

  with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from<br/>

  Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with<br/>

  400,000 to 500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of<br/>

  foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union<br/>

  markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar<br/>

  subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial<br/>

  activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged<br/>

  by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time.<br/>

  In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job<br/>

  losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a<br/>

  difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the<br/>

  interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term<br/>

  problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights,<br/>

  and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas<br/>

  remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased<br/>

  significantly. Fiji's current account deficit reached 23% of GDP in<br/>

  2006.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101061">Finland<br/>

  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market<br/>

  economy with per capita output roughly that of Austria, Belgium, the<br/>

  Netherlands, and Sweden. Trade is important with exports accounting<br/>

  for over one third of GDP in recent years. Finland is strongly<br/>

  competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals,<br/>

  engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland<br/>

  excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber<br/>

  and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials,<br/>

  energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the<br/>

  climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining<br/>

  self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export<br/>

  earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population.<br/>

  Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU<br/>

  in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the<br/>

  worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit<br/>

  exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing<br/>

  one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of<br/>

  exports stimulated economic growth in 2010, and led to a lowering of<br/>

  unemployment. The recession left a deep mark on general government<br/>

  finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget<br/>

  surpluses into deficits. In the next few years, the great challenge<br/>

  of economic policy will be to implement a post-recession exit<br/>

  strategy in which measures supporting growth will be combined with<br/>

  general government adjustment measures. Longer-term, Finland must<br/>

  address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that<br/>

  threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.<br/>

<p id="id101062" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">France
  France is in the midst of transition from a well-to-do modern
  economy that has featured extensive government ownership and
  intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
  government has partially or fully privatized many large companies,
  banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as
  Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a
  strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public
  transport, and defense industries. With at least 75 million foreign
  tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world
  and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism.
  France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they
  maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social
  spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets
  on public health and welfare. France has weathered the global
  economic crisis better than most other big EU economies because of
  the relative resilience of domestic consumer spending, a large
  public sector, and less exposure to the downturn in global demand
  than in some other countries. Nonetheless, France's real GDP
  contracted 2.5% in 2009, but recovered somewhat in 2010, while the
  unemployment rate increased from 7.4% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2010. The
  government pursuit of aggressive stimulus and investment measures in
  response to the economic crisis, however, are contributing to a
  deterioration of France's public finances. The government budget
  deficit rose sharply from 3.4% of GDP in 2008 to 7.8% of GDP in
  2010, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to 84% over
  the same period. Paris is terminating stimulus measures, eliminating
  tax credits, and freezing most government spending to bring the
  budget deficit under the 3% euro-zone ceiling by 2013, and to
  highlight France's commitment to fiscal discipline at a time of
  intense financial market scrutiny of euro zone debt levels.
  President SARKOZY - who secured passage of pension reform in 2010 -
  is expected to seek passage of some tax reforms in 2011, but he may
  delay additional, more costly, reforms until after the 2012 election.</p>

<p id="id101063">French Polynesia<br/>

  Since 1962, when France stationed military<br/>

  personnel in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a<br/>

  subsistence agricultural economy to one in which a high proportion<br/>

  of the work force is either employed by the military or supports the<br/>

  tourist industry. With the halt of French nuclear testing in 1996,<br/>

  the military contribution to the economy fell sharply. Tourism<br/>

  accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary source of hard<br/>

  currency earnings. Other sources of income are pearl farming and<br/>

  deep-sea commercial fishing. The small manufacturing sector<br/>

  primarily processes agricultural products. The territory benefits<br/>

  substantially from development agreements with France aimed<br/>

  principally at creating new businesses and strengthening social<br/>

  services.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101064">French Southern and Antarctic Lands<br/>

  Economic activity is limited to<br/>

  servicing meteorological and geophysical research stations, military<br/>

  bases, and French and other fishing fleets. The fish catches landed<br/>

  on Iles Kerguelen by foreign ships are exported to France and<br/>

  Reunion.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101065">Gabon<br/>

  Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most<br/>

  sub-Saharan African nations, but because of high income inequality,<br/>

  a large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on<br/>

  timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early<br/>

  1970s. The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of GDP although<br/>

  the industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production.<br/>

  Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and<br/>

  manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction<br/>

  of 1.4% in 2009. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor<br/>

  fiscal management hobbles the economy. In 1997, an IMF mission to<br/>

  Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget<br/>

  items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its<br/>

  schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of<br/>

  oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth, but drops in production<br/>

  have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. Gabon<br/>

  signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007, and<br/>

  later that year issued a $1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a<br/>

  sizable portion of its Paris Club debt.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101066">Gambia, The<br/>

  The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits and a<br/>

  limited agricultural base, and relies in part on remittances from<br/>

  workers overseas and tourist receipts. About three-quarters of the<br/>

  population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood.<br/>

  Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of<br/>

  peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity<br/>

  to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West<br/>

  Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in<br/>

  eco-tourism and upscale facilities. In the past few years, The<br/>

  Gambia's re-export trade - traditionally a major segment of economic<br/>

  activity - has declined, but its banking sector has grown rapidly.<br/>

  Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high; economic<br/>

  progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on<br/>

  responsible government economic management, and on continued<br/>

  technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. The<br/>

  quality of fiscal management, however, is weak. The government has<br/>

  promised to raise civil service wages over the next two years and<br/>

  the deficit is projected to worsen.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101067">Gaza Strip<br/>

  High population density, limited land and sea access,<br/>

  continuing isolation, and strict internal and external security<br/>

  controls have degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the<br/>

  smaller of the two areas in the Palestinian Territories.<br/>

  Israeli-imposed crossings closures, which became more restrictive<br/>

  after HAMAS violently took over the territory in June 2007, and<br/>

  fighting between HAMAS and Israel during December 2008-January 2009,<br/>

  resulted in the near collapse of most of the private sector,<br/>

  extremely high unemployment, and high poverty rates. Shortages of<br/>

  goods are met through large-scale humanitarian assistance - led by<br/>

  UNRWA - and the HAMAS-regulated black market tunnel trade that<br/>

  flourishes under the Gaza Strip's border with Egypt. However,<br/>

  chnages to the blockade in 2010 included moving from a white list -<br/>

  in which only approved items were allowed into Gaza through the<br/>

  crossings - to a black list, where all but non-approved items were<br/>

  allowed into Gaza through the crossings. Israeli authorities have<br/>

  recently signaled that exports from the territory might be possible<br/>

  in the future, but currently regular exports from Gaza are not<br/>

  permitted.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101068" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Georgia
  Georgia's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10% in
  2006-07, based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust
  government spending. However, GDP growth slowed in 2008 following
  the August 2008 conflict with Russia, and turned negative in 2009 as
  foreign direct investment and workers' remittances declined in the
  wake of the global financial crisis, but rebounded in 2010.
  Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation of
  agricultural products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts;
  mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial
  sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, metals,
  machinery, aircraft and chemicals. Areas of recent improvement
  include growth in the construction, banking services, and mining
  sectors, but reduced availability of external investment and the
  slowing regional economy are emerging risks. The country imports
  nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products. It
  has sizeable hydropower capacity, a growing component of its energy
  supplies. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas
  supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and
  by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan
  instead of from Russia. The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan
  oil pipeline, the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline, and the
  Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on
  Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its
  role as a transit point for gas, oil and other goods. Georgia has
  historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax
  revenues; however, the government, since coming to power in 2004,
  has simplified the tax code, improved tax administration, increased
  tax enforcement, and cracked down on petty corruption. However, the
  economic downturn of 2008-09 eroded the tax base and led to a
  decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing
  needs. The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a
  determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing
  regulation, taxes, and corruption in order to attract foreign
  investment, but the economy faces a more difficult investment
  climate both domestically and internationally.</p>

<p id="id101069" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Germany
  The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world
  in PPP terms and Europe's largest - is a leading exporter of
  machinery, vehicles, chemicals, and household equipment and benefits
  from a highly skilled labor force. Like its western European
  neighbors, Germany faces significant demographic challenges to
  sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and declining net
  immigration are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare
  system and necessitate structural reforms. The modernization and
  integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can
  exceed 20% in some municipalities - continues to be a costly
  long-term process, with annual transfers from west to east amounting
  in 2008 alone to roughly $12 billion. Reforms launched by the
  government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed
  necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average
  growth, contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling
  unemployment, which in 2008 reached a new post-reunification low of
  7.8%. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced
  working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in
  unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World
  War II - and its healthy decrease in 2010. GDP contracted nearly 5%
  in 2009 but grew by 3.3% in 2010. Germany crept out of recession
  thanks largely to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports -
  primarily outside the Euro Zone - and relatively steady consumer
  demand. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and
  2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second
  term increased Germany's budget deficit to 3.3% in 2009 and to 3.6%
  in 2010. The EU has given Germany until 2013 to get its consolidated
  budget deficit below 3% of GDP. A new constitutional amendment
  likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no
  more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016.</p>

<p id="id101070">Ghana<br/>

  Ghana is well endowed with natural resources and agriculture<br/>

  accounts for roughly one-third of GDP and employs more than half of<br/>

  the workforce, mainly small landholders. The services sector<br/>

  accounts for 50% of GDP. Gold and cocoa production and individual<br/>

  remittances are major sources of foreign exchange. Oil production at<br/>

  Ghana's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December and is expected<br/>

  to boost economic growth. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge<br/>

  Corporation (MCC) Compact in 2006, which aims to assist in<br/>

  transforming Ghana's agricultural sector. Ghana opted for debt<br/>

  relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in<br/>

  2002, and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief<br/>

  Initiative that took effect in 2006. In 2009 Ghana signed a<br/>

  three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF to<br/>

  improve macroeconomic stability, private sector competitiveness,<br/>

  human resource development, and good governance and civic<br/>

  responsibility. Sound macro-economic management along with high<br/>

  prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth in 2008-10. In<br/>

  early 2010 President John Atta MILLS targeted recovery from high<br/>

  inflation and current account and budget deficits as his priorities.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101071">Gibraltar<br/>

  Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive<br/>

  shipping trade, offshore banking, and its position as an<br/>

  international conference center. Tax rates are low to attract<br/>

  foreign investment. The British military presence has been sharply<br/>

  reduced and now contributes about 7% to the local economy, compared<br/>

  with 60% in 1984. The financial sector, tourism (almost 5 million<br/>

  visitors in 1998), gaming revenues, shipping services fees, and<br/>

  duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. The financial<br/>

  sector, tourism, and the shipping sector contribute 30%, 30%, and<br/>

  25%, respectively, of GDP. Telecommunications, e-commerce, and<br/>

  e-gaming account for the remaining 15%. In recent years, Gibraltar<br/>

  has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector<br/>

  economy, but changes in government spending still have a major<br/>

  impact on the level of employment.<br/>

<p id="id101072" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Greece
  Greece has a capitalist economy with the public sector
  accounting for about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP about
  two-thirds that of the leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides
  15% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force,
  mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major
  beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek
  economy grew by nearly 4.0% per year between 2003 and 2007, due
  partly to infrastructural spending related to the 2004 Athens
  Olympic Games, and in part to an increased availability of credit,
  which has sustained record levels of consumer spending. But the
  economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world
  financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure
  to address a growing budget deficit, which was triggered by falling
  state revenues, and increased government expenditures. The economy
  contracted by 2% in 2009, and 4.8% in 2010. Greece violated the EU's
  Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than
  3% of GDP from 2001 to 2006, but finally met that criterion in
  2007-08, before exceeding it again in 2009, with the deficit
  reaching 15.4% of GDP. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to
  9.4% of GDP in 2010. Public debt, inflation, and unemployment are
  above the euro-zone average while per capita income is below;
  unemployment rose to 12% in 2010. Eroding public finances, a
  credibility gap stemming from inaccurate and misreported statistics,
  and consistent underperformance on following through with reforms
  prompted major credit rating agencies in late 2009 to downgrade
  Greece's international debt rating, and has led the country into a
  financial crisis. Under intense pressure by the EU and international
  market participants, the government has adopted a medium-term
  austerity program that includes cutting government spending,
  reducing the size of the public sector, decreasing tax evasion,
  reforming the health care and pension systems, and improving
  competitiveness through structural reforms to the labor and product
  markets. Athens, however, faces long-term challenges to push through
  unpopular reforms in the face of often vocal opposition from the
  country's powerful labor unions and the general public. Greek labor
  unions are striking over new austerity measures, but the strikes so
  far have had a limited impact on the government's will to adopt
  reforms. An uptick in widespread unrest, however, could challenge
  the government's ability to implement reforms and meet budget
  targets, and could also lead to rioting or violence. In April 2010 a
  leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit
  rating; in May, the International Monetary Fund and Eurozone
  governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans
  worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to
  creditors. In exchange for the largest bailout ever assembled, the
  government announced combined spending cuts and tax increases
  totaling $40 billion over three years, on top of the tough austerity
  measures already taken. Greece, however, struggled to boost revenues
  and cut spending to meet 2010 targets set by the EU and the IMF,
  especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised
  upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. Greece's
  lenders are calling on Athens to step up efforts in 2011 to increase
  tax collection, shore up public enterprises, and rein in health
  spending, and are planning to give Greece more time to repay its
  EU-IMF loan. Greece responded by introducing major structural
  reforms, but investors still question whether Greece can sustain
  fiscal efforts in the face of a bleak economic outlook and public
  discontent.</p>

<p id="id101073">Greenland<br/>

  The economy remains critically dependent on exports of<br/>

  shrimp and fish and on a substantial subsidy - about $650 million in<br/>

  2009 - from the Danish Government, which supplies nearly 60% of<br/>

  government revenues. The public sector, including publicly owned<br/>

  enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in<br/>

  Greenland's economy. Greenland's GDP contracted about 2% in 2009 as<br/>

  a result of the global economic slowdown. Budget surpluses turned to<br/>

  deficits beginning in 2007 and unemployment has risen. During the<br/>

  last decade the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued<br/>

  conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has<br/>

  increased for better schools, health care and retirement systems.<br/>

  The Greenlandic economy has benefited from increasing catches and<br/>

  exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due<br/>

  to Greenland's continued dependence on exports of fish - which<br/>

  account for 82% of exports - the economy remains very sensitive to<br/>

  foreign developments. International consortia are increasingly<br/>

  active in exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's<br/>

  western coast, and international studies indicate the potential for<br/>

  oil and gas fields in northern and northeastern Greenland. In May<br/>

  2007 a US aluminum producer concluded a memorandum of understanding<br/>

  with the Greenland Home Rule Government to build an aluminum smelter<br/>

  and a power generation facility, which takes advantage of<br/>

  Greenland's abundant hydropower potential. Within the area of<br/>

  mining, olivine sand continues to be produced and gold production<br/>

  has resumed in south Greenland. Tourism also offers another avenue<br/>

  of economic growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise<br/>

  lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters<br/>

  during the peak summer tourism season.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101074">Grenada<br/>

  Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign<br/>

  exchange especially since the construction of an international<br/>

  airport in 1985. Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Emily (2005) severely<br/>

  damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa<br/>

  cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth.<br/>

  Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes<br/>

  but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process.<br/>

  Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110%, leaving the THOMAS administration<br/>

  limited room to engage in public investments and social spending.<br/>

  Strong performances in construction and manufacturing, together with<br/>

  the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry, have<br/>

  also contributed to growth in national output; however, economic<br/>

  growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009,<br/>

  because of the global economic slowdown's effects on tourism and<br/>

  remittances.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101075">Guam<br/>

  The economy depends largely on US military spending and<br/>

  tourism. Total US grants, wage payments, and procurement outlays<br/>

  amounted to $1.3 billion in 2004. Over the past 30 years, the<br/>

  tourist industry has grown to become the largest income source<br/>

  following national defense. The Guam economy continues to experience<br/>

  expansion in both its tourism and military sectors.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101076" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Guatemala
  Guatemala is the most populous of the Central American
  countries with a GDP per capita roughly one-half that of the average
  for Latin America and the Caribbean. The agricultural sector
  accounts for nearly 15% of GDP and half of the labor force; key
  agricultural exports include coffee, sugar, and bananas. The 1996
  peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major
  obstacle to foreign investment, and since then Guatemala has pursued
  important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The Central
  American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in July
  2006 spurring increased investment and diversification of exports,
  with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional
  agricultural exports. While CAFTA has helped improve the investment
  climate, concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers and
  poor infrastructure continue to hamper foreign direct investment.
  The distribution of income remains highly unequal with the richest
  decile comprising over 40% of Guatemala's overall consumption. More
  than half of the population is below the national poverty line and
  15% lives in extreme poverty. Poverty among indigenous groups, which
  make up 38% of the population, averages 76% and extreme poverty
  rises to 28%. 43% of children under five are chronically
  malnourished, one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world.
  President COLOM entered into office with the promise to increase
  education, healthcare, and rural development, and in April 2008 he
  inaugurated a conditional cash transfer program, modeled after
  programs in Brazil and Mexico, that provide financial incentives for
  poor families to keep their children in school and get regular
  health check-ups. Given Guatemala's large expatriate community in
  the United States, it is the top remittance recipient in Central
  America, with inflows serving as a primary source of foreign income
  equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports. Economic growth fell in
  2009 as export demand from US and other Central American markets
  fell and foreign investment slowed amid the global recession, but
  the economy recovered gradually in 2010 and will likely return to
  more normal growth rates by 2012. President COLOM, in his last year
  in office, will likely face opposition to economic reform,
  particularly over a long-delayed tax reform and an IMF-recommended
  reform to strengthen the banking sector. Larger budget deficits and
  increased debt can be expected in 2011.</p>

<p id="id101077">Guernsey<br/>

  Financial services - banking, fund management, insurance -<br/>

  account for about 23% of employment and about 55% of total income in<br/>

  this tiny, prosperous Channel Island economy. Tourism,<br/>

  manufacturing, and horticulture, mainly tomatoes and cut flowers,<br/>

  have been declining. Financial services, construction, retail, and<br/>

  the public sector have been growing. Light tax and death duties make<br/>

  Guernsey a popular tax haven. The evolving economic integration of<br/>

  the EU nations is changing the environment under which Guernsey<br/>

  operates.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101078">Guinea<br/>

  Guinea is a poor country that possesses major mineral,<br/>

  hydropower, and agricultural resources. The country has almost half<br/>

  of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounts for more<br/>

  than 70% of exports. Long-run improvements in the management of the<br/>

  economy, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country<br/>

  is to move out of poverty. Investor confidence has been sapped by<br/>

  rampant corruption, a lack of electricity and other infrastructure,<br/>

  a lack of skilled workers, and the political uncertainty resulting<br/>

  from the death of President Lansana CONTE in December 2008.<br/>

  International donors, including the G-8, the IMF, and the World<br/>

  Bank, cut their development programming significantly in response to<br/>

  the coup, and international partners have said that a resumption of<br/>

  aid will be contingent on a successful democratic transition with a<br/>

  democratically elected president and a functioning National<br/>

  Assembly. Growth rose slightly in 2006-08, primarily due to<br/>

  increases in global demand and commodity prices on world markets,<br/>

  but bauxite and alumina exports were negatively affected by the<br/>

  global economic downturn and the economy in 2009 contracted.<br/>

  International investors expressed renewed interest in Guinea's iron<br/>

  ore mines in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101079">Guinea-Bissau<br/>

  One of the poorest countries in the world,<br/>

  Guinea-Bissau's legal economy depends mainly on farming and fishing,<br/>

  but trafficking narcotics is probably the most lucrative trade.<br/>

  Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years.<br/>

  Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of<br/>

  peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the major crop and staple<br/>

  food. However, intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed<br/>

  government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the<br/>

  country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy<br/>

  in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with<br/>

  partial recovery in 1999-2002. In December 2003, the World Bank,<br/>

  IMF, and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary<br/>

  support in the amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over<br/>

  80% of the total national budget. The combination of limited<br/>

  economic prospects, a weak and faction-ridden government, and<br/>

  favorable geography have made this West African country a way<br/>

  station for drugs bound for Europe.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101080">Guyana<br/>

  The Guyanese economy exhibited moderate economic growth in<br/>

  recent years and is based largely on agriculture and extractive<br/>

  industries. The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six<br/>

  commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which<br/>

  represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible<br/>

  to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices.<br/>

  Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME)<br/>

  in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily<br/>

  in the raw materials sector. Economic recovery since a 2005<br/>

  flood-related contraction was buoyed by increases in remittances and<br/>

  foreign direct investment in the sugar and rice industries as well<br/>

  as the mining sector. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled<br/>

  labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is juggling a<br/>

  sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public<br/>

  investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank,<br/>

  Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million<br/>

  debt, equivalent to nearly 48% of GDP, which along with other Highly<br/>

  Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the<br/>

  debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 120% in 2007. Guyana<br/>

  became heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led<br/>

  development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Growth slowed in<br/>

  2009-10 as a result of the world recession. The slowdown in the<br/>

  domestic economy and lower import costs helped to narrow the<br/>

  country's current account deficit, despite generally lower earnings<br/>

  from exports.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101081">Haiti<br/>

  Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7.1 magnitude<br/>

  earthquake damaged its capital city, Port-au-Prince, in January<br/>

  2010. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80%<br/>

  of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject<br/>

  poverty, the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country's GDP to<br/>

  contract an estimated 8% in 2010. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend<br/>

  on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming,<br/>

  and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters,<br/>

  exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic<br/>

  engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through<br/>

  Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has<br/>

  boosted apparel exports and investment by providing tariff-free<br/>

  access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation<br/>

  until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act (HELP); the apparel<br/>

  sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly<br/>

  one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign<br/>

  exchange, equaling nearly a quarter of GDP and more than twice the<br/>

  earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment<br/>

  because of insecurity and limited infrastructure, and a severe trade<br/>

  deficit. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving<br/>

  the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt<br/>

  forgiveness for over $1 billion of its debt through the<br/>

  Highly-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative in 2009. The<br/>

  remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor<br/>

  countries in early 2010 but has since climbed back to about $500<br/>

  million. The government relies on formal international economic<br/>

  assistance for fiscal sustainability.<br/>
