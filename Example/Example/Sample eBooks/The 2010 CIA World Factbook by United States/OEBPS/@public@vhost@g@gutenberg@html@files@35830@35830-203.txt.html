<p id="id101083">Holy See (Vatican City)<br/>

  The Holy See is supported financially by a<br/>

  variety of sources, including investments, real estate income, and<br/>

  donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions;<br/>

  these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic<br/>

  missions, and media outlets. The separate Vatican City State budget<br/>

  includes the Vatican museums and post office and is supported<br/>

  financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals, and tourist<br/>

  mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications<br/>

  sales. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and<br/>

  direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence,<br/>

  which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief, and<br/>

  aid to churches in developing nations. The incomes and living<br/>

  standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who<br/>

  work in the city of Rome.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101084">Honduras<br/>

  Honduras, the second poorest country in Central America,<br/>

  suffers from extraordinarily unequal distribution of income, as well<br/>

  as high underemployment. While historically dependent on the export<br/>

  of bananas and coffee, Honduras has diversified its export base to<br/>

  include apparel and automobile wire harnessing. Nearly half of<br/>

  Honduras's economic activity is directly tied to the US, with<br/>

  exports to the US equivalent to 30% of GDP and remittances for<br/>

  another 20%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)<br/>

  came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foriegn direct<br/>

  investment, but physical and political insecurity may deter<br/>

  potential investors; about 70% of FDI is from US firms. The economy<br/>

  registered marginally positive economic growth in 2010, insufficient<br/>

  to improve living standards for the nearly 60% of the population in<br/>

  poverty. The LOBO administration inherited a difficult fiscal<br/>

  position with off-budget debts accrued in previous administrations<br/>

  and government salaries nearly equivalent to tax collections. His<br/>

  government has displayed a commitment to improving tax collection<br/>

  and cutting expenditures. This enabled Tegucigalpa to secure an IMF<br/>

  Precautionary Stand-By agreement in October 2010. The IMF agreement<br/>

  has helped renew multilateral and bilateral donor confidence in<br/>

  Honduras following the ZELAYA administration's economic<br/>

  mismanagement and the political coup.<br/>

<p id="id101085" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Hong Kong
  Hong Kong has a free market economy highly dependent on
  international trade and finance - the value of goods and services
  trade, including the sizable share of re-exports, is about four
  times GDP. Hong Kong's open economy left it exposed to the global
  economic slowdown, but its increasing integration with China,
  through trade, tourism, and financial links, helped it recover more
  quickly than many observers anticipated. The Hong Kong government is
  promoting the Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the site for
  Chinese renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Hong Kong residents are
  allowed to establish RMB-denominated savings accounts;
  RMB-denominated corporate and Chinese government bonds have been
  issued in Hong Kong; and RMB trade settlement is allowed. The
  territory far exceeded the RMB conversion quota set by Beijing for
  trade settlements in 2010 due to the growth of earnings from exports
  to the mainland. RMB deposits grew to roughly 3.6% of total system
  deposits in Hong Kong by October 2010, an increase of over 250%
  since the beginning of the year. The government is pursuing efforts
  to introduce additional use of RMB in Hong Kong financial markets
  and is seeking to expand the RMB quota for 2011. The mainland has
  long been Hong Kong's largest trading partner, accounting for about
  half of Hong Kong's exports by value. Hong Kong's natural resources
  are limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. As a
  result of China's easing of travel restrictions, the number of
  mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5 million in
  2001 to 17.7 million in 2009, outnumbering visitors from all other
  countries combined. Hong Kong has also established itself as the
  premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. In
  2009 mainland Chinese companies constituted about 40% of the firms
  listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and accounted for 60% of the
  Exchange's market capitalization. During the past decade, as Hong
  Kong's manufacturing industry moved to the mainland, its service
  industry has grown rapidly and in 2009 accounted for more than 90%
  of the territory's GDP. GDP growth averaged a strong 4% from 1989 to
  2008. Hong Kong's GDP fell in 2009 as a result of the global
  financial crisis, but a recovery began in third quarter 2009, and
  the economy grew nearly 6% in 2010. The Hong Kong government adopted
  several temporary fiscal policy support measures in response to the
  crisis that it may discontinue if strong growth is sustained. Credit
  expansion and tight housing supply conditions caused Hong Kong
  property prices to rise rapidly in 2010, and some lower income
  segments of the population are increasingly unable to afford
  adequate housing. Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely
  to the US dollar, maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.</p>

<p id="id101086">Hungary<br/>

  Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to<br/>

  a market economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of<br/>

  the EU-25 average. The private sector accounts for more than 80% of<br/>

  GDP. Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are<br/>

  widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more<br/>

  than $70 billion. The government's austerity measures, imposed since<br/>

  late 2006, have reduced the budget deficit from over 9% of GDP in<br/>

  2006 to 3.8% in 2010. Hungary's impending inability to service its<br/>

  short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late<br/>

  2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF-arranged financial assistance<br/>

  package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn,<br/>

  declining exports, and low domestic consumption and fixed asset<br/>

  accumulation, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in<br/>

  an economic contraction of 6.3% in 2009. The economy rebounded in<br/>

  2010 with a big boost from exports, and growth of more than 2.5% is<br/>

  expected in 2011. Unemployment remained high, at more than 11%.<br/>

<p id="id101087" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Iceland
  Iceland's Scandinavian-type social-market economy combines a
  capitalist structure and free-market principles with an extensive
  welfare system. Prior to the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high
  growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of
  income. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which
  provides 40% of export earnings, more than 12% of GDP, and employs
  7% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks
  as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports:
  fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Iceland's
  economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service
  industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of
  software production, biotechnology, and tourism. Abundant geothermal
  and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment
  in the aluminum sector and boosted economic growth, although the
  financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much
  of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a
  boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the
  country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in
  foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in
  foreign currencies, following the privatization of the banking
  sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions
  throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona
  vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic
  banks, whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the
  country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks
  collapsed in late 2008. The country secured over $10 billion in
  loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and
  financial sector, and to back government guarantees for foreign
  deposits in Icelandic banks. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment
  peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. GDP fell 3.4% in 2010. Since the
  collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic
  priorities have included: stabilizing the krona, reducing Iceland's
  high budget deficit, containing inflation, restructuring the
  financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Three new banks were
  established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks.
  Two of them have foreign majority ownership, while the State holds a
  majority of the shares of the third. British and Dutch authorities
  have pressed claims totaling over $5 billion against Iceland to
  compensate their citizens for losses suffered on deposits held in
  the failed Icelandic bank, Landsbanki Islands. Iceland agreed to new
  terms with the UK and the Netherlands to compensate British and
  Dutch depositors, but the agreement must first be approved by the
  Icelandic President. Iceland began EU accession negotiations with
  the EU in July 2010, however, public support has dropped
  substantially because of concern about losing control over fishing
  resources and in reaction to measures taken by Brussels during the
  ongoing Eurozone crisis.</p>

<p id="id101088" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">India
  India is developing into an open-market economy, yet traces of
  its past autarkic policies remain. Economic liberalization,
  including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned
  enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment,
  began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country's
  growth, which has averaged more than 7% per year since 1997. India's
  diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern
  agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a
  multitude of services. Slightly more than half of the work force is
  in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic
  growth, accounting for more than half of India's output, with only
  one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large
  educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of
  information technology services and software workers. In 2010, the
  Indian economy rebounded robustly from the global financial crisis -
  in large part because of strong domestic demand - and growth
  exceeded 8% year-on-year in real terms. Merchandise exports, which
  account for about 15% of GDP, returned to pre-financial crisis
  levels. An industrial expansion and high food prices, resulting from
  the combined effects of the weak 2009 monsoon and inefficiencies in
  the government's food distribution system, fueled inflation which
  peaked at about 11% in the first half fo 2010, but has gradually
  decreased to single digits following a series of central bank
  interest rate hikes. New Delhi in 2010 reduced subsidies in fuel and
  fertilizers, sold a small percentage of its shares in some
  state-owned enterprises and auctioned off rights to radio bandwidth
  for 3G telecommunications in part to lower the government's deficit.
  The Indian Government seeks to reduce its deficit to 5.5% of GDP in
  FY 2010-11, down from 6.8% in the previous fiscal year. India's long
  term challenges include widespread poverty, inadequate physical and
  social infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment
  opportunities, insufficient access to quality basic and higher
  education, and accommodiating rual-to-urban migration.</p>

<p id="id101089">Indian Ocean<br/>

  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting<br/>

  the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas.<br/>

  It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum<br/>

  products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its<br/>

  fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries<br/>

  for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia,<br/>

  Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly<br/>

  for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped<br/>

  in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western<br/>

  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production<br/>

  comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and<br/>

  offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering<br/>

  countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,<br/>

  and Thailand.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101090">Indonesia<br/>

  Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, has weathered the<br/>

  global financial crisis relatively smoothly because of its heavy<br/>

  reliance on domestic consumption as the driver of economic growth.<br/>

  Although the economy slowed significantly in 2009 from the 6%-plus<br/>

  growth rate recorded in 2007 and 2008, by 2010 growth returned to a<br/>

  6% rate. During the recession, Indonesia outperformed its regional<br/>

  neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting<br/>

  growth. The government made economic advances under the first<br/>

  administration of President YUDHOYONO, introducing significant<br/>

  reforms in the financial sector, including tax and customs reforms,<br/>

  the use of Treasury bills, and capital market development and<br/>

  supervision. Indonesia's debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years has<br/>

  declined steadily because of increasingly robust GDP growth and<br/>

  sound fiscal stewardship. Indonesia still struggles with poverty and<br/>

  unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex<br/>

  regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among<br/>

  regions. YUDHOYONO's reelection, with respected economist BOEDIONO<br/>

  as his vice president, suggests broad continuity of economic policy,<br/>

  although the start of their term has been marred by corruption<br/>

  scandals and the departure of an internationally respected finance<br/>

  minister. The government in 2010 faces the ongoing challenge of<br/>

  improving Indonesia's insufficient infrastructure to remove<br/>

  impediments to economic growth, while addressing climate change<br/>

  mitigation and adaptation needs, particularly with regard to<br/>

  conserving Indonesia's forests and peatlands, the focus of a<br/>

  potentially trailblazing $1 billion REDD+ pilot project.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101091">Iran<br/>

  Iran's economy is marked by an inefficient state sector,<br/>

  reliance on the oil sector, which provides the majority of<br/>

  government revenues, and statist policies, which create major<br/>

  distortions throughout the system. Private sector activity is<br/>

  typically limited to small-scale workshops, farming, and services.<br/>

  Price controls, subsidies, and other rigidities weigh down the<br/>

  economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth.<br/>

  Significant informal market activity flourishes. The legislature in<br/>

  late 2009 passed President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD's bill to reduce<br/>

  subsidies, particularly on food and energy. The bill would phase out<br/>

  subsidies - which benefit Iran's upper and middle classes the most -<br/>

  over three to five years and replace them with cash payments to<br/>

  Iran's lower classes. However, the start of the program was delayed<br/>

  repeatedly throughout 2010 over fears of public reaction to higher<br/>

  prices. This is the most extensive economic reform since the<br/>

  government implemented gasoline rationing in 2007. The recovery of<br/>

  world oil prices in the last year increased Iran's oil export<br/>

  revenue by at least $10 billion over 2009, easing some of the<br/>

  financial impact of the newest round of international sanctions.<br/>

  Although inflation has fallen substantially since the mid-2000s,<br/>

  Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and<br/>

  underemployment. Underemployment among Iran's educated youth has<br/>

  convinced many to seek jobs overseas, resulting in a significant<br/>

  "brain drain."<br/>

<p id="id101092" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Iraq
  An improved security environment and an initial wave of foreign
  investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in
  the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic
  improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the
  standard of living still depend on the government passing major
  policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil
  reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing
  interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in
  acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments.
  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides over
  90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings.
  Since mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen
  before Operation Iraqi Freedom and government revenues have
  rebounded, along with global oil prices. In 2011 Baghdad probably
  will increase oil exports above the current level of 1.9 million
  barrels per day (bbl/day) as a result of new contracts with
  international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the 2.4
  million bbl/day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq is making
  modest progress in building the institutions needed to implement
  economic policy. In 2010, Bagdad signed a new agreement with both
  the IMF and World Bank for conditional aid programs that will help
  strengthen Iraq's economic institutions. Some reform-minded leaders
  within the Iraqi government are seeking to pass laws to strengthen
  the economy. This legislation includes a package of laws to
  establish a modern legal framework for the oil sector and a
  mechanism to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation,
  although these and other important reforms are still under
  contentious and sporadic negotiation. Iraq's recent contracts with
  major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil
  revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing,
  pipeling, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach
  their potential. The Government of Iraq is pursuing a strategy to
  gain additional foreign investment in Iraq's economy. This includes
  an amendment to the National Investment Law, multiple international
  trade and investment events, as well as potential participation in
  joint ventures with state-owned enterprises. Provincial Councils
  also are using their own budgets to promote and facilitate
  investment at the local level. However, widespread corruption,
  inadequate infrastructure, insufficient essential services, and
  antiquated commercial laws and regulations stifle investment and
  continue to constrain the growth of private, non-energy sectors. The
  Central Bank has successfully held the exchange rate at
  approximately 1,170 Iraqi dinar/US dollar since January 2009.
  Inflation has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security
  situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed
  to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary
  Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country.
  Reducing corruption and implementing reforms - such as bank
  restructuring and developing the private sector - would be important
  steps in this direction.</p>

<p id="id101093" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Ireland
  Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy. Ireland
  joined 11 other EU nations in circulating the euro on 1 January
  2002. GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has
  dropped sharply since 2008 with GDP falling by over 3% in 2008,
  nearly 8% in 2009, and 1% in 2010, and further contraction is
  expectd in 2011. Ireland entered into a recession for the first time
  in more than a decade with the onset of the world financial crisis
  and subsequent severe slowdown in its domestic property and
  construction markets. Agriculture, once the most important sector,
  is now dwarfed by industry and services. Although the export sector,
  dominated by foreign multinationals, remains a key component of
  Ireland's economy, construction most recently fueled economic growth
  along with strong consumer spending and business investment.
  Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to
  2007 than in any other developed economy. However, average home
  prices have fallen 50% from the 2007 peak. In 2008 the COWEN
  government moved to guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the
  banking system, and establish partly-public venture capital funds in
  response to the country's economic downturn. In 2009, in an effort
  to stabilize the banking sector, the Irish Government established
  the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem
  commercial property and development loans from Irish banks. Faced
  with sharply reduced revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the
  Irish Government introduced the first in a series of draconian
  budgets in 2009. In addition to across-the-board cuts in spending,
  the 2009 budget included wage reductions for all public servants.
  These measures were not sufficient. The budget deficit reached
  nearly 38% of GDP in 2010 because of additional government support
  for the banking sector. In late 2010, the COWEN Government agreed to
  a $112 billion loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin
  recapitalize its banking sector and avoid defaulting on its
  sovereign debt, and initiated a four-year austerity plan to cut an
  additional $20 billion from its budget.</p>

<p id="id101094">Isle of Man<br/>

  Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key<br/>

  sectors of the economy. The government offers low taxes and other<br/>

  incentives to high-technology companies and financial institutions<br/>

  to locate on the island; this has paid off in expanding employment<br/>

  opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture<br/>

  and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in<br/>

  their contributions to GDP. The Isle of Man also attracts online<br/>

  gambling sites and the film industry. Trade is mostly with the UK.<br/>

  The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU markets.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101095" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Israel
  Israel has a technologically advanced market economy. It
  depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
  equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
  developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20
  years. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
  products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel
  usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by large
  transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of
  the government's external debt is owed to the US, its major source
  of economic and military aid. Israel's GDP, after contracting
  slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and
  troubles in the high-technology sector, grew about 5% per year from
  2004-07. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief
  recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid
  fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series
  of liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector, and the
  economy has shown signs of an early recovery. Following GDP growth
  of 4% in 2008, Israel's GDP slipped to 0.2% in 2009, but reached
  3.4% in 2010, as exports rebounded. The global economic downturn
  affected Israel's economy primarily through reduced demand for
  Israel's exports in the United States and EU, Israel's top trading
  partners. Exports account for about 25% of the country's GDP. The
  Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a
  modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary
  monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows,
  purchasing government bonds, and intervening in the foreign currency
  market. The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the
  summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank's
  target and the economy began to show signs of recovery.</p>

<p id="id101096">Italy
  Italy has a diversified industrial economy, which is divided
  into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies,
  and a less-developed, welfare-dependent, agricultural south, with
  high unemployment. The Italian economy is driven in large part by
  the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and
  medium-sized enterprises, many of them family owned. Italy also has
  a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for
  as much as 15% of GDP. These activities are most common within the
  agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy has moved
  slowly on implementing needed structural reforms, such as reducing
  graft, overhauling costly entitlement programs, and increasing
  employment opportunities for young workers, particularly women. The
  international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy's labor
  market, with unemployment rising from 6.2% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2010,
  but in the longer-term Italy's low fertility rate and quota-driven
  immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy. A rise in
  exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery
  nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1% in 2010 following a
  5% contraction in 2009. The Italian government has struggled to
  limit government spending, but Italy's exceedingly high public debt
  remains above 115% of GDP, and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5% of GDP
  in 2007 - exceeded 5% in 2009 and 2010, as the costs of servicing
  the country's debt rose.</p>

<p id="id101097">Jamaica<br/>

  The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services, which<br/>

  now account for more than 60% of GDP. The country continues to<br/>

  derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and<br/>

  bauxite/alumina. Remittances account for nearly 15% of GDP and<br/>

  exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10%. Tourism revenues<br/>

  account for roughly 10% of GDP, and both arrivals and revenues grew<br/>

  in 2010, up 4% and 6% respectively. The Economic growth faces many<br/>

  challenges: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and<br/>

  underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120%.<br/>

  Jamaica's onerous debt burden - the fourth highest per capita - is<br/>

  the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy,<br/>

  most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s. The<br/>

  Government of Jamaica signed a $1.27 billion, 27-month Standby<br/>

  Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of<br/>

  payment support in February 2010. Other multilaterals have also<br/>

  provided millions of dollars in loans and grants. The government's<br/>

  difficult fiscal position hinders spending on infrastructure and<br/>

  social programs, particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking<br/>

  economy. The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of<br/>

  having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt<br/>

  payments, while simultaneously attacking a serious and growing crime<br/>

  problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment<br/>

  exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is<br/>

  fueled by the drug trade.<br/>

<p id="id101099" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Japan
  In the years following World War II, government-industry
  cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high technology, and a
  comparatively small defense allocation (1% of GDP) helped Japan
  develop a technologically advanced economy. Two notable
  characteristics of the post-war economy were the close interlocking
  structures of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, known as
  keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial
  portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding
  under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic
  demographic change. Japan's industrial sector is heavily dependent
  on imported raw materials and fuels. A tiny agricultural sector is
  highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest
  in the world. Usually self sufficient in rice, Japan imports about
  60% of its food on a caloric basis. Japan maintains one of the
  world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
  global catch. For three decades, overall real economic growth had
  been spectacular - a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the
  1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the
  1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the after effects of
  inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s
  that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess
  debt, capital, and labor. The Japanese financial sector was not
  heavily exposed to sub-prime mortgages or their derivative
  instruments and weathered the initial effect of the recent global
  credit crunch, but a sharp downturn in business investment and
  global demand for Japan's exports in late 2008 pushed Japan further
  into recession. Government stimulus spending helped the economy
  recover in late 2009 and 2010, but Tokyo is warning that GDP growth
  will slow in 2011. Prime Minister Kan's government has proposed
  opening the agricultural and services sectors to greater foreign
  competition and boosting exports through free-trade agreements, but
  debate continues on restructuring the economy and funding new
  stimulus programs in the face of a tight fiscal situation. Japan's
  huge government debt, which is approaching 200 percent of GDP,
  persistent deflation, and an aging and shrinking population are
  major complications for the economy.</p>

<p id="id101100">Jersey<br/>

  Jersey's economy is based on international financial<br/>

  services, agriculture, and tourism. In 2005 the finance sector<br/>

  accounted for about 50% of the island's output. Potatoes,<br/>

  cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export<br/>

  crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is<br/>

  known worldwide and represents an important export income earner.<br/>

  Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. Tourism accounts<br/>

  for one-quarter of GDP. In recent years, the government has<br/>

  encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey with the result that<br/>

  an electronics industry has developed, displacing more traditional<br/>

  industries. All raw material and energy requirements are imported as<br/>

  well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death<br/>

  duties make the island a popular tax haven. Living standards come<br/>

  close to those of the UK.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101101">Jordan<br/>

  Jordan's economy is among the smallest in the Middle East,<br/>

  with insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other natural<br/>

  resources, underlying the government's heavy reliance on foreign<br/>

  assistance. Other economic challenges for the government include<br/>

  chronic high rates of poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large<br/>

  budget deficit. Since assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has<br/>

  implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening the trade<br/>

  regime, privatizing state-owned companies, and eliminating most fuel<br/>

  subsidies, which in the past few years have spurred economic growth<br/>

  by attracting foreign investment and creating some jobs. The global<br/>

  economic slowdown, however, has depressed Jordan's GDP growth.<br/>

  Export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and the<br/>

  transport of re-exports have been hit the hardest. The Government<br/>

  approved two supplementary budgets in 2010, but sweeping tax cuts<br/>

  planned for 2010 did not materialize because of Amman's need for<br/>

  additional revenue to cover excess spending. The budget deficit is<br/>

  likely to remain high, at 5-6% of GDP, and Amman likely will<br/>

  continue to depend heavily on foreign assistance to finance the<br/>

  deficit in 2011. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively<br/>

  isolated from the international financial crisis because of its<br/>

  limited exposure to overseas capital markets. Jordan is currently<br/>

  exploring nuclear power generation to forestall energy shortfalls.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101102">Kazakhstan<br/>

  Kazakhstan, geographically the largest of the former<br/>

  Soviet republics, excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil fuel<br/>

  reserves and plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals, such<br/>

  as uranium, copper, and zinc. It also has a large agricultural<br/>

  sector featuring livestock and grain. Kazakhstan's industrial sector<br/>

  is primarily focused on the extraction and processing of these<br/>

  natural resources. Kazakhstan enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01<br/>

  and 8% or more per year in 2002-07 - thanks largely to its booming<br/>

  energy sector but also to economic reform, good harvests, and<br/>

  increased foreign investment; GDP growth slowed dramatically<br/>

  following the near-collapse of the banking sector in late 2007 and<br/>

  the declines in oil and metals prices associated with the global<br/>

  economic downturn in 2008-09. Kazakhstan has embarked upon an<br/>

  industrial policy designed to diversify the economy away from<br/>

  overdependence on the oil sector as well expanding export markets<br/>

  away from its historical reliance on Russia. Nevertheless, growth is<br/>

  still driven by oil. The government has engaged in several disputes<br/>

  with Western oil companies over the terms of production agreements,<br/>

  most recently, with regard to the Kashagan project in 2007-08 and<br/>

  the Karachaganak project in 2009.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101103">Kenya<br/>

  Although the regional hub for trade and finance in East<br/>

  Africa, Kenya has been hampered by corruption and by reliance upon<br/>

  several primary goods whose prices have remained low. In 1997, the<br/>

  IMF suspended Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to<br/>

  the government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption.<br/>

  The IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through a<br/>

  drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to<br/>

  institute several anticorruption measures. In the key December 2002<br/>

  elections, Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old reign ended, and a new<br/>

  opposition government took on the formidable economic problems<br/>

  facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out<br/>

  corruption and encouraging donor support, the KIBAKI government was<br/>

  rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the<br/>

  World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on<br/>

  corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have<br/>

  since resumed lending, despite little action on the government's<br/>

  part to deal with corruption. Post-election violence in early 2008,<br/>

  coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on<br/>

  remittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to 1.7 in 2008, but the<br/>

  economy rebounded in 2009-10.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101104">Kiribati<br/>

  A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has<br/>

  few natural resources and is one of the least developed Pacific<br/>

  Islands. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at<br/>

  the time of independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now<br/>

  represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has<br/>

  fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development is<br/>

  constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure,<br/>

  and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more<br/>

  than one-fifth of GDP. Private sector initiatives and a financial<br/>

  sector are in the early stages of development. Foreign financial aid<br/>

  from the EU, UK, US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UN<br/>

  agencies, and Taiwan accounts for 20-25% of GDP. Remittances from<br/>

  seamen on merchant ships abroad account for more than $5 million<br/>

  each year. Kiribati receives around $15 million annually for the<br/>

  government budget from an Australian trust fund.<br/>

<p id="id101105" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Korea, North
  North Korea, one of the world's most centrally directed
  and least open economies, faces chronic economic problems.
  Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of
  years of underinvestment and shortages of spare parts. Large-scale
  military spending draws off resources needed for investment and
  civilian consumption. Industrial and power output have declined in
  parallel from pre-1990 levels. Severe flooding in the summer of 2007
  aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic
  problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming
  practices, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel.
  Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the
  people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine
  threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from
  prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the
  government has allowed private "farmers' markets" to begin selling a
  wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an
  experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In
  October 2005, the government tried to reverse some of these policies
  by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a
  centralized food rationing system. By December 2005, the government
  terminated most international humanitarian assistance operations in
  North Korea (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and
  restricted the activities of remaining international and
  non-governmental aid organizations. In mid-2008, North Korea began
  receiving food aid under a US program to deliver 500,000 metric tons
  of food via the World Food Program and US nongovernmental
  organizations; but Pyongyang stopped accepting the aid in March
  2009. In December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of
  its currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be
  exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week
  window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use
  yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease
  the restrictions by February 2010. Nevertheless, firm political
  control remains the Communist government's overriding concern, which
  likely will inhibit changes to North Korea's current economic system.</p>

<p id="id101106">Korea, South<br/>

  Since the 1960s, South Korea has achieved an incredible<br/>

  record of growth and global integration to become a high-tech<br/>

  industrialized economy. Four decades ago, GDP per capita was<br/>

  comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia.<br/>

  In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world<br/>

  economies, and currently is among the world's 20 largest economies.<br/>

  Initially, a system of close government and business ties, including<br/>

  directed credit and import restrictions, made this success possible.<br/>

  The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology<br/>

  at the expense of consumer goods, and encouraged savings and<br/>

  investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98<br/>

  exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model<br/>

  including high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign<br/>

  borrowing. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in<br/>

  1999-2000. Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the<br/>

  crisis, including greater openness to foreign investment and<br/>

  imports. Growth moderated to about 4-5% annually between 2003 and<br/>

  2007. With the global economic downturn in late 2008, South Korean<br/>

  GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, the<br/>

  economy began to recover, in large part due to export growth, low<br/>

  interest rates, and an expansionary fiscal policy, and growth<br/>

  exceeded 6% in 2010. The South Korean economy's long term challenges<br/>

  include a rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, and<br/>

  overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth.<br/>

<p id="id101107" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Kosovo
  Over the past few years Kosovo's economy has shown
  significant progress in transitioning to a market-based system and
  maintaining macroeconomic stability, but it is still highly
  dependent on the international community and the diaspora for
  financial and technical assistance. Remittances from the diaspora -
  located mainly in Germany and Switzerland - are estimated to account
  for about 14% of GDP, and donor-financed activities and aid for
  another 7.5%. Kosovo's citizens are the poorest in Europe with an
  average annual per capita income of only $2,500. Unemployment,
  around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that
  encourages outward migration and black market activity. Most of
  Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital,
  Pristina. Inefficient, near-subsistence farming is common - the
  result of small plots, limited mechanization, and lack of technical
  expertise. With international assistance, Kosovo has been able to
  privatize 50% of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by number, and
  over 90% of SOEs by value. Minerals and metals - including lignite,
  lead, zinc, nickel, chrome, aluminum, magnesium, and a wide variety
  of construction materials - once formed the backbone of industry,
  but output has declined because of ageing equipment and insufficient
  investment. A limited and unreliable electricity supply due to
  technical and financial problems is a major impediment to economic
  development. Kosovo's Ministry of Energy and Mining has solicited
  expressions of interest from private investors to develop a new
  power plant in order to address Kosovo and the region's unmet and
  growing demands for power. The official currency of Kosovo is the
  euro, but the Serbian dinar is also used in Serb enclaves. Kosovo's
  tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo has one
  of the most open economies in the region, and continues to work with
  the international community on measures to improve the business
  environment and attract foreign investment. Kosovo has kept the
  government budget in balance as a result of efficient value added
  tax (VAT) collection at the borders and inefficient budget
  execution. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic
  structures, UNMIK signed (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the
  Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA) in 2006. However, Serbia and
  Bosnia have refused to recognize Kosovo's customs stamp or extend
  reduced tariff privileges for Kosovo products under CEFTA. In July
  2008, Kosovo received pledges of $1.9 billion from 37 countries in
  support of its reform priorities. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the
  World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and Kosovo began
  servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt.</p>

<p id="id101108">Kuwait<br/>

  Kuwait has a geographically small, but wealthy, relatively<br/>

  open economy with self-reported crude oil reserves of about 102<br/>

  billion barrels - about 9% of world reserves. Petroleum accounts for<br/>

  nearly half of GDP, 95% of export revenues, and 95% of government<br/>

  income. Kuwaiti officials have committed to increasing oil<br/>

  production to 4 million barrels per day by 2020. The rise in global<br/>

  oil prices throughout 2010 is reviving government consumption and<br/>

  economic growth as Kuwait experiences a 20% increase in government<br/>

  budget revenue. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in<br/>

  part, because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due<br/>

  to the poor business climate and the acrimonious relationship<br/>

  between the National Assembly and the executive branch, which has<br/>

  stymied most movement on economic reforms. Nonetheless, the<br/>

  government in May 2010 passed a privatization bill that allows the<br/>

  government to sell assets to private investors, and in January<br/>

  passed an economic development plan that pledges to spend up to $130<br/>

  billion in five years to diversify the economy away from oil,<br/>

  attract more investment, and boost private sector participation in<br/>

  the economy. Increasing government expenditures by so large an<br/>

  amount during the planned time frame may be difficult to accomplish.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101109" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Kyrgyzstan
  Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with a dominant
  agricultural sector. Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main
  agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported
  in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium,
  natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold
  exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine. Following
  independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market
  reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform.
  Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
  country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of
  the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in
  production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
  December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and
  exports began to increase. In 2005, the BAKIEV government and
  international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive
  medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. Bishkek
  agreed to pursue much needed tax reform and, in 2006, became
  eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.
  The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial
  fiscal deficit, nearly closing the gap between revenues and
  expenditures in 2006, before boosting expenditures more than 20% in
  2007-08. GDP grew about 8% annually in 2007-08, partly due to higher
  gold prices internationally, but slowed to 2.3% in 2009. The
  overthrow of President BAKIEV in April, 2010 and subsequent ethnic
  clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Shrinking
  trade and agricultural production, as well as political instability,
  caused GDP to contract about 3.5% in 2010. The fiscal deficit
  widened to 12% of GDP, reflecting significant increases in
  crisis-related spending, including both rehabilitation of damaged
  infrastructure and bank recapitalization. Progress in
  reconstruction, fighting corruption, restructuring domestic
  industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to
  future growth.</p>

<p id="id101110">Laos<br/>

  The government of Laos, one of the few remaining one-party<br/>

  Communist states, began decentralizing control and encouraging<br/>

  private enterprise in 1986. The results, starting from an extremely<br/>

  low base, were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008<br/>

  except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial<br/>

  crisis that began in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos<br/>

  remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure,<br/>

  particularly in rural areas. It has a rudimentary, but improving,<br/>

  road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications.<br/>

  Electricity is available in urban areas and in many rural districts.<br/>

  Subsistence agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland<br/>

  areas, accounts for about 30% of GDP and provides 80% of total<br/>

  employment. The government in FY08/09 received $560 million from<br/>

  international donors. Economic growth has reduced official poverty<br/>

  rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in 2009. The economy has benefited<br/>

  from high foreign investment in hydropower, mining, and<br/>

  construction. Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US<br/>

  in 2004, and is taking steps required to join the World Trade<br/>

  Organization, such as reforming import licensing. Related trade<br/>

  policy reforms will improve the business environment. On the fiscal<br/>

  side, Laos launched an effort to ensure the collection of taxes in<br/>

  2009 as the global economic slowdown reduced revenues from mining<br/>

  projects. Simplified investment procedures and expanded bank credits<br/>

  for small farmers and small entrepreneurs will improve Lao's<br/>

  economic prospects. The government appears committed to raising the<br/>

  country's profile among investors. The World Bank has declared that<br/>

  Laos's goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of<br/>

  least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable. According Laotian<br/>

  officials, the 7th Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011-15 will<br/>

  outline efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101111">Latvia<br/>

  Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per<br/>

  year during 2006-07 but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a<br/>

  result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt<br/>

  exposure amid the softening world economy. GDP plunged 18% in 2009 -<br/>

  the three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's worst<br/>

  declines that year - and another 1.8% in 2010. The IMF, EU, and<br/>

  other donors provided assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement<br/>

  to defend the currency's peg to the euro and reduce the fiscal<br/>

  deficit to about 5% of GDP over time. DOMBROVSKIS' government<br/>

  enacted major speding cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit to 7.8% of<br/>

  GDP in 2010, and plans to cut the deficit further in 2011. The<br/>

  majority of companies, banks, and real estate have been privatized,<br/>

  although the state still holds sizable stakes in a few large<br/>

  enterprises. Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization<br/>

  in February 1999. EU membership, a top foreign policy goal, came in<br/>

  May 2004.<br/>

<p id="id101112" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Lebanon
  Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire
  commercial tradition. The government does not restrict foreign
  investment; however, the investment climate suffers from red tape,
  corruption, arbitrary licensing decisions, high taxes, tariffs, and
  fees, archaic legislation, and weak intellectual property rights.
  The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth sectors
  include banking and tourism. The 1975-90 civil war seriously damaged
  Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and
  all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and
  banking hub. In the years since, Lebanon has rebuilt much of its
  war-torn physical and financial infrastructure by borrowing heavily
  - mostly from domestic banks. In an attempt to reduce the ballooning
  national debt, the Rafiq HARIRI government in 2000 began an
  austerity program, reining in government expenditures, increasing
  revenue collection, and passing legislation to privatize state
  enterprises, but economic and financial reform initiatives stalled
  and public debt continued to grow despite receipt of more than $2
  billion in bilateral assistance at the 2002 Paris II Donors
  Conference. The Israeli-Hizballah conflict in July-August 2006
  caused an estimated $3.6 billion in infrastructure damage, and
  prompted international donors to pledge nearly $1 billion in
  recovery and reconstruction assistance. Donors met again in January
  2007 at the Paris III Donor Conference and pledged more than $7.5
  billion to Lebanon for development projects and budget support,
  conditioned on progress on Beirut's fiscal reform and privatization
  program. An 18-month political stalemate and sporadic sectarian and
  political violence hampered economic activity, particularly tourism,
  retail sales, and investment, until the new government was formed in
  July 2008. Political stability following the Doha Accord of May 2008
  helped boost tourism and, together with a strong banking sector,
  enabled real GDP growth of 7% per year in 2009-10 despite a slowdown
  in the region.</p>

<p id="id101113">Lesotho<br/>

  Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho relies on<br/>

  remittances from miners employed in South Africa, customs duties<br/>

  from the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), and export revenue<br/>

  for the majority of government revenue. However, the government has<br/>

  recently strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs<br/>

  duties. Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998<br/>

  permitted the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties<br/>

  for Lesotho. Lesotho produces about 90% of its own electrical power<br/>

  needs. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the<br/>

  past several years, a small manufacturing base has developed based<br/>

  on farm products that support the milling, canning, leather, and<br/>

  jute industries, as well as an apparel-assembly sector. Despite<br/>

  Lesotho's market-based economy being heavily tied to its neighbor<br/>

  South Africa, the US is an important trade partner because of the<br/>

  export sector's heavy dependence on apparel exports. Exports have<br/>

  grown significantly because of the trade benefits contained in the<br/>

  Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The economy is still primarily<br/>

  based on subsistence agriculture, especially livestock, although<br/>

  drought has decreased agricultural activity. The extreme inequality<br/>

  in the distribution of income remains a major drawback. Lesotho has<br/>

  signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the<br/>

  IMF. In July 2007, Lesotho signed a Millennium Challenge Account<br/>

  Compact with the US worth $362.5 million. Economic growth dropped in<br/>

  2009, due mainly to the effects of the global economic crisis as<br/>

  demand for the country's exports declined and SACU revenue fell<br/>

  precipitously when South Africa - the primary contributor to the<br/>

  SACU revenue pool - went into recession, but growth returned to 3.5%<br/>

  in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101114">Liberia<br/>

  Liberia is a low income country heavily reliant on foreign<br/>

  assistance for revenue. Civil war and government mismanagement<br/>

  destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure<br/>

  in and around the capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the<br/>

  country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the<br/>

  conclusion of fighting and the installation of a<br/>

  democratically-elected government in 2006, several have returned.<br/>

  Liberia has the distinction of having the highest ratio of direct<br/>

  foreign investment to GDP in the world. Richly endowed with water,<br/>

  mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture,<br/>

  Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products,<br/>

  primarily raw timber and rubber and is reviving those sectors. Local<br/>

  manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.<br/>

  President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-trained banker and<br/>

  administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support<br/>

  from international donors, and encourage private investment.<br/>

  Embargos on timber and diamond exports have been lifted, opening new<br/>

  sources of revenue for the government and Liberia shipped its first<br/>

  major timber exports to Europe in 2010. The country reached its<br/>

  Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative completion point in 2010<br/>

  and nearly $5 billion of international debt was permanently<br/>

  eliminated. This new status will enable Liberia to estabilish a<br/>

  sovereign credit rating and issue bonds. Liberia's Paris Club<br/>

  creditors agreed to cancel Liberia's debt as well. Rebuilding<br/>

  infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on generous financial<br/>

  and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment<br/>

  in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation.<br/>

<p id="id101115" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Libya
  The Libyan economy depends primarily upon revenues from the
  oil sector, which contribute about 95% of export earnings, 25% of
  GDP, and 80% of government revenue. The weakness in world
  hydrocarbon prices in 2009 reduced Libyan government tax income and
  constrained economic growth. Substantial revenues from the energy
  sector coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest
  per capita GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to
  the lower orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years
  have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign
  to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort
  picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and
  as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs
  to build weapons of mass destruction. The process of lifting US
  unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were
  removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign direct
  investment, especially in the energy sector. Libyan oil and gas
  licensing rounds continue to draw high international interest; the
  National Oil Corporation (NOC) set a goal of nearly doubling oil
  production to 3 million bbl/day by 2012. In November 2009, the NOC
  announced that that target may slip to as late as 2017. Libya faces
  a long road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy,
  but initial steps - including applying for WTO membership, reducing
  some subsidies, and announcing plans for privatization - are laying
  the groundwork for a transition to a more market-based economy. The
  non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for
  more than 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
  agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,
  iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils
  severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of
  its food. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the
  Great Manmade River Project, but significant resources are being
  invested in desalinization research to meet growing water demands.</p>

<p id="id101116">Liechtenstein<br/>

  Despite its small size and limited natural resources,<br/>

  Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly<br/>

  industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial<br/>

  service sector and the highest per capita income in the world. The<br/>

  Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of<br/>

  small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% -<br/>

  and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to<br/>

  establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state<br/>

  revenues. The country participates in a customs union with<br/>

  Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It<br/>

  imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has<br/>

  been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving<br/>

  as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and<br/>

  the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its<br/>

  economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008,<br/>

  Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure -<br/>

  particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking<br/>

  and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax<br/>

  Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's<br/>

  conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD<br/>

  in October 2009 removed the principality from its "grey list" of<br/>

  countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax<br/>

  Convention.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101117">Lithuania<br/>

  Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade<br/>

  Organization and joined the EU in May 2004. Despite Lithuania's EU<br/>

  accession, Lithuania's trade with its Central and Eastern European<br/>

  neighbors, and Russia in particular, accounts for a growing<br/>

  percentage of total trade. Privatization of the large, state-owned<br/>

  utilities is nearly complete. Foreign government and business<br/>

  support have helped in the transition from the old command economy<br/>

  to a market economy. Lithuania's economy grew on average 8% per year<br/>

  for the four years prior to 2008 driven by exports and domestic<br/>

  demand. However, GDP plunged nearly 15% in 2009 - during the 2008-09<br/>

  crisis the three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's<br/>

  worst economic declines. In 2009, the government launched a<br/>

  high-profile campaign, led by Prime Minister KUBILIUS, to attract<br/>

  foreign investment and to develop export markets. The current<br/>

  account deficit, which had risen to roughly 15% of GDP in 2007-08,<br/>

  recovered to a surplus of 4% 2009 and 3.5% in 2010 in the wake of a<br/>

  cutback in imports to almost half the 2008 level. Nevertheless,<br/>

  economic growth was flat and unemployment continued upward to 16% in<br/>

  2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101118">Luxembourg<br/>

  This small, stable, high-income economy - benefiting from<br/>

  its proximity to France, Belgium, and Germany - has historically<br/>

  featured solid growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The<br/>

  industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become<br/>

  increasingly diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other<br/>

  products. Growth in the financial sector, which now accounts for<br/>

  about 28% of GDP, has more than compensated for the decline in<br/>

  steel. Most banks are foreign owned and have extensive foreign<br/>

  dealings, but Luxembourg has lost some of its advantages as a tax<br/>

  haven because of OECD and EU pressure. The economy depends on<br/>

  foreign and cross-border workers for about 60% of its labor force.<br/>

  Luxembourg, like all EU members, suffered from the global economic<br/>

  crisis that began in late 2008, but unemployment has trended below<br/>

  the EU average. Following strong expansion from 2004 to 2007,<br/>

  Luxembourg's economy contracted and 3.4% in 2009, but rebounded 2.6%<br/>

  in 2010. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high<br/>

  standard of living - GDP per capita ranks third in the world, after<br/>

  Liechtenstein and Qatar, and is the highest in the EU. Turmoil in<br/>

  the world financial markets and lower global demand during 2008-09<br/>

  prompted the government to inject capital into the banking sector<br/>

  and implement stimulus measures to boost the economy. Government<br/>

  stimulus measures and support for the banking sector, however, led<br/>

  to a 5% government budget deficit in 2009, however, the deficit was<br/>

  cut below 3% in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101119">Macau<br/>

  Macau's economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the<br/>

  global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010, largely<br/>

  on the back of strong tourism and gaming sectors. After opening up<br/>

  its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in<br/>

  2001, the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign<br/>

  investment, transforming Macau into one of the world's largest<br/>

  gaming center. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by<br/>

  China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens<br/>

  wishing to visit Macau. By 2006, Macau's gaming revenue surpassed<br/>

  that of the Las Vegas strip, and gaming-related taxes accounted for<br/>

  more than 70% of total government revenue. In 2008, Macau introduced<br/>

  measures to cool the rapidly developing sector. This city of nearly<br/>

  570,000 hosted more than 21 million visitors in 2009. Almost 51%<br/>

  came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry<br/>

  has virtually disappeared since the termination of the Multi-Fiber<br/>

  Agreement in 2005. In 2009, total exports were less than US$1<br/>

  billion, while gaming receipts were almost US$15 billion. By October<br/>

  2010, gross gaming revenue had already reached US$19 billion for the<br/>

  year. The Macau government plans to tighten control over the opening<br/>

  of new casinos and strengthen supervision of local casino operations<br/>

  in 2011 and has introduced measures to diversify the economy. The<br/>

  Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Macau and<br/>

  mainland China that came into effect on 1 January 2004 offers<br/>

  Macau-made products tariff-free access to the mainland;<br/>

  nevertheless, China remains Macau's third largest goods export<br/>

  market, behind Hong Kong and the United States. Macau's currency,<br/>

  the Pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also<br/>

  freely accepted in the territory.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101120">Macedonia<br/>

  Having a small, open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to<br/>

  economic developments in Europe and dependent on regional<br/>

  integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic<br/>

  growth. At independence in September 1991, Macedonia was the least<br/>

  developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the<br/>

  total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of<br/>

  Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and<br/>

  eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area.<br/>

  An absence of infrastructure, UN sanctions on the downsized<br/>

  Yugoslavia, and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the<br/>

  country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth<br/>

  until 1996. Since then, Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic<br/>

  stability with low inflation, but it has so far lagged the region in<br/>

  attracting foreign investment and creating jobs, despite making<br/>

  extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment<br/>

  remains high at 33%, but may be overstated based on the existence of<br/>

  an extensive gray market, estimated to be more than 20% of GDP, that<br/>

  is not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global<br/>

  economic downturn, Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign<br/>

  direct investment, lowered credit, and a large trade deficit, but<br/>

  the financial system remained sound. Macroeconomic stability was<br/>

  maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which kept the domestic<br/>

  currency at the pegged level against the euro, at the expense of<br/>

  raising interest rates. As a result, GDP fell in 2009. but returned<br/>

  to positive in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101121">Madagascar<br/>

  After discarding socialist economic policies in the<br/>

  mid-1990s, Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of<br/>

  privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the<br/>

  start of the political crisis. This strategy placed the country on a<br/>

  slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level.<br/>

  Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the<br/>

  economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing<br/>

  80% of the population. Exports of apparel have boomed in recent<br/>

  years primarily due to duty-free access to the US. However,<br/>

  Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African<br/>

  Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the<br/>

  country's duty-free access in January 2010. Deforestation and<br/>

  erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of<br/>

  fuel, are serious concerns. Former President RAVALOMANANA worked<br/>

  aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political<br/>

  crisis, which triggered a 12% drop in GDP that year. The current<br/>

  political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional<br/>

  blows to the economy. Tourism dropped more than 50% in 2009,<br/>

  compared with the previous year, and many investors are wary of<br/>

  entering the uncertain investment environment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101122">Malawi<br/>

  Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's most densely<br/>

  populated and least developed countries. The economy is<br/>

  predominately agricultural with about 80% of the population living<br/>

  in rural areas. Agriculture, which has benefited from fertilizer<br/>

  subsidies since 2006, accounts for more than one-third of GDP and<br/>

  90% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key<br/>

  to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of<br/>

  exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic<br/>

  assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor<br/>

  nations. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily<br/>

  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In December 2007, the US<br/>

  granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support<br/>

  within the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. The<br/>

  government faces many challenges including developing a market<br/>

  economy, improving educational facilities, facing up to<br/>

  environmental problems, dealing with the rapidly growing problem of<br/>

  HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is<br/>

  being tightened. Since 2005 President MUTHARIKA'S government has<br/>

  exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of<br/>

  Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year Poverty<br/>

  Reduction and Growth Facility worth $56 million with the IMF.<br/>

  Improved relations with the IMF lead other international donors to<br/>

  resume aid as well. The government has announced infrastructure<br/>

  projects that could yield improvements, such as a new oil pipeline,<br/>

  for better fuel access, and the potential for a waterway link<br/>

  through Mozambican rivers to the ocean, for better transportation<br/>

  options. Since 2009, however, Malawi experienced some setbacks,<br/>

  including a general shortage of foreign exchange, which has damaged<br/>

  its ability to pay for imports, and fuel shortages that hinder<br/>

  transportation and productivity. Investment fell 23% in 2009. The<br/>

  government has failed to address barriers to investment such as<br/>

  unreliable power, water shortages, poor telecommunications<br/>

  infrastructure, and the high costs of services.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101123">Malaysia<br/>

  Malaysia, a middle-income country, has transformed itself<br/>

  since the 1970s from a producer of raw materials into an emerging<br/>

  multi-sector economy. Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia<br/>

  is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move<br/>

  farther up the value-added production chain by attracting<br/>

  investments in Islamic finance, high technology industries, medical<br/>

  technology, and pharmaceuticals. The NAJIB administration also is<br/>

  continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and to wean the economy<br/>

  off of its dependence on exports. Nevertheless, exports -<br/>

  particularly of electronics - remain a significant driver of the<br/>

  economy. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from<br/>

  higher world energy prices, although the rising cost of domestic<br/>

  gasoline and diesel fuel, combined with strained government<br/>

  finances, has forced Kuala Lumpur to reduce government subsidies.<br/>

  The government is also trying to lessen its dependence on state oil<br/>

  producer Petronas, which supplies at least 40% of government<br/>

  revenue. The central bank maintains healthy foreign exchange<br/>

  reserves and its well-developed regulatory regime has limited<br/>

  Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global<br/>

  financial crisis. Nevertheless, decreasing worldwide demand for<br/>

  consumer goods hurt Malaysia's exports and economic growth in 2009,<br/>

  although both showed signs of recovery in 2010. In order to attract<br/>

  increased investment, NAJIB has also sought to revise the special<br/>

  economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the<br/>

  New Economic Policy of 1970, but he has encountered significant<br/>

  opposition, especially from Malay nationalists.<br/>
