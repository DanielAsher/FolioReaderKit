  Tourism, Maldives' largest economic activity, accounts for<br/>

  28% of GDP and more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts. Over 90%<br/>

  of government tax revenue comes from import duties and<br/>

  tourism-related taxes. Fishing is the second leading sector.<br/>

  Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the<br/>

  economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land<br/>

  and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be<br/>

  imported. The Maldivian Government implemented economic reforms,<br/>

  beginning in 1989 that initially lifted import quotas, opened some<br/>

  exports to the private sector, and liberalized regulations to allow<br/>

  more foreign investment. Real GDP growth averaged over 7.5% per year<br/>

  for more than a decade, and registered 18% in 2006, due to a rebound<br/>

  in tourism and reconstruction following the tsunami of December<br/>

  2004. GDP slowed in 2007-08, then contracted in 2009 due to the<br/>

  global recession. Falling tourist arrivals and fish exports,<br/>

  combined with high government spending on social needs, subsidies,<br/>

  and civil servant salaries contributed to a balance of payments<br/>

  crisis, which was eased with a December 2009, $79.3 million dollar<br/>

  IMF standby agreement. Diversifying the economy beyond tourism and<br/>

  fishing, reforming public finance, and increasing employment<br/>

  opportunities are major challenges facing the government. Over the<br/>

  longer term Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion<br/>

  and possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the<br/>

  area is 1 meter or less above sea level.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101125">Mali<br/>

  Among the 25 poorest countries in the world, Mali is a<br/>

  landlocked country highly dependent on gold mining and agricultural<br/>

  exports for revenue. The country's fiscal status fluctuates with<br/>

  gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest. Mali remains<br/>

  dependent on foreign aid. Economic activity is largely confined to<br/>

  the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its<br/>

  land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is<br/>

  nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and<br/>

  fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm<br/>

  commodities. The government has continued an IMF-recommended<br/>

  structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow,<br/>

  diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali is developing its<br/>

  cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue<br/>

  sources because gold production has started to fall. Mali has<br/>

  invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry.<br/>

  Mali's adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the<br/>

  CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5%<br/>

  average in 1996-2010. Worker remittances and external trade routes<br/>

  for the landlocked country have been jeopardized by continued unrest<br/>

  in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire, however, Mali is building a road<br/>

  network that will connect it to all adjacent countries and it has a<br/>

  railway line to Senegal. In 2010, Mali experienced a regional<br/>

  drought that hurt livestock and livelihoods.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101126">Malta<br/>

  Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited<br/>

  fresh water supplies, and has few domestic energy sources. Malta's<br/>

  geographic position between the EU and Africa makes it a target for<br/>

  illegal immigration, which has strained Malta's political and<br/>

  economic resources. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008.<br/>

  Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in<br/>

  2008-09 it escaped significant damage from the international<br/>

  financial crisis, largely because the sector is centered on the<br/>

  indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged. Locally,<br/>

  the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed<br/>

  to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent<br/>

  risk-management practices. The global economic downturn and high<br/>

  electricity and water prices hurt Malta's real economy, which is<br/>

  dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing - especially electronics<br/>

  and pharmaceuticals - and tourism, but growth bounced back as the<br/>

  global economy recovered in 2010. Following a 1.2% contraction in<br/>

  2009, GDP grew 2% in 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101127">Marshall Islands<br/>

  US Government assistance is the mainstay of this<br/>

  tiny island economy. The Marshall Islands received more than $1<br/>

  billion in aid from the US from 1986-2002. Agricultural production,<br/>

  primarily subsistence, is concentrated on small farms; the most<br/>

  important commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit. Small-scale<br/>

  industry is limited to handicrafts, tuna processing, and copra. The<br/>

  tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange employing<br/>

  less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for future<br/>

  added income. The islands have few natural resources, and imports<br/>

  far exceed exports. Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free<br/>

  Association, the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the<br/>

  Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2023, at which time a Trust Fund made<br/>

  up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts.<br/>

  Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline<br/>

  in tourism, and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel<br/>

  licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1% over the past<br/>

  decade.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101128">Mauritania<br/>

  Half the population still depends on agriculture and<br/>

  livestock for a livelihood, even though many of the nomads and<br/>

  subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent<br/>

  droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits<br/>

  of iron ore, which account for nearly 40% of total exports. The<br/>

  nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the<br/>

  world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source<br/>

  of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near<br/>

  Nouakchott in 1986. Before 2000, drought and economic mismanagement<br/>

  resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In February 2000, Mauritania<br/>

  qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries<br/>

  (HIPC) initiative and nearly all of its foreign debt has since been<br/>

  forgiven. A new investment code approved in December 2001 improved<br/>

  the opportunities for direct foreign investment. Mauritania and the<br/>

  IMF agreed to a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility<br/>

  (PRGF) arrangement in 2006. Mauritania made satisfactory progress,<br/>

  but the IMF, World Bank, and other international actors suspended<br/>

  assistance and investment in Mauritania after the August 2008 coup.<br/>

  Since the presidential election in July 2009, donors have resumed<br/>

  assistance. Oil prospects, while initially promising, have largely<br/>

  failed to materialize, and the government has placed a priority on<br/>

  attracting private investment to spur economic growth. The<br/>

  Government also emphasizes reduction of poverty, improvement of<br/>

  health and education, and privatization of the economy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101129">Mauritius<br/>

  Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a<br/>

  low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income<br/>

  diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist<br/>

  sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order<br/>

  of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more<br/>

  equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered<br/>

  infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy<br/>

  rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial<br/>

  services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and<br/>

  communications technology, and hospitality and property development.<br/>

  Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and<br/>

  accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development<br/>

  strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of<br/>

  development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than<br/>

  32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South<br/>

  Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has<br/>

  reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector,<br/>

  has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and<br/>

  Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and<br/>

  prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects from<br/>

  the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew 3.6% in 2010 and<br/>

  the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach<br/>

  around the globe.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101130">Mayotte<br/>

  Economic activity is based primarily on the agricultural<br/>

  sector, including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte is not self<br/>

  sufficient and must import a large portion of its food requirements,<br/>

  mainly from France. The economy and future development of the island<br/>

  are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an important<br/>

  supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle to the<br/>

  development of tourism.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101131">Mexico<br/>

  Mexico has a free market economy in the trillion dollar<br/>

  class. It contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and<br/>

  agriculture, increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent<br/>

  administrations have expanded competition in seaports, railroads,<br/>

  telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas<br/>

  distribution, and airports. Per capita income is roughly one-third<br/>

  that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Since<br/>

  the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement<br/>

  (NAFTA) in 1994, Mexico's share of US imports has increased from 7%<br/>

  to 12%, and its share of Canadian imports has doubled to 5%. Mexico<br/>

  has free trade agreements with over 50 countries including,<br/>

  Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European Free Trade Area, and<br/>

  Japan, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements.<br/>

  In 2007, during its first year in office, the Felipe CALDERON<br/>

  administration was able to garner support from the opposition to<br/>

  successfully pass pension and fiscal reforms. The administration<br/>

  passed an energy reform measure in 2008, and another fiscal reform<br/>

  in 2009. Mexico's GDP plunged 6.5% in 2009 as world demand for<br/>

  exports dropped and asset prices tumbled, but GDP posted positive<br/>

  growth of 5% in 2010, with export growth leading the way. The<br/>

  administration continues to face many economic challenges, including<br/>

  improving the public education system, upgrading infrastructure,<br/>

  modernizing labor laws, and fostering private investment in the<br/>

  energy sector. CALDERON has stated that his top economic priorities<br/>

  remain reducing poverty and creating jobs.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101132">Micronesia, Federated States of<br/>

  Economic activity consists primarily<br/>

  of subsistence farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral<br/>

  deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The<br/>

  potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remote location, a<br/>

  lack of adequate facilities, and limited air connections hinder<br/>

  development. Under the original terms of the Compact of Free<br/>

  Association, the US provided $1.3 billion in grant aid during the<br/>

  period 1986-2001; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced.<br/>

  The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the<br/>

  Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) millions of dollars in annual<br/>

  aid through 2023, and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and<br/>

  the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts<br/>

  to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023. The country's medium-term<br/>

  economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US<br/>

  assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101133" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Moldova
  Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe
  despite recent progress from its small economic base. It enjoys a
  favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral
  deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture,
  featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import
  almost all of its energy supplies. Moldova's dependence on Russian
  energy was underscored at the end of 2005, when a Russian-owned
  electrical station in Moldova's separatist Transnistria region cut
  off power to Moldova and Russia's Gazprom cut off natural gas in
  disputes over pricing. In January 2009, gas supplies were cut during
  a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's decision to ban
  Moldovan wine and agricultural products, coupled with its decision
  to double the price Moldova paid for Russian natural gas, have hurt
  growth. The onset of the global financial crisis and poor economic
  conditions in Moldova's main foreign markets, caused GDP to fall
  6.5% in 2009. Unemployment almost doubled and inflation disappeared
  - at -0.1%, a record low. Moldova's IMF agreement expired in May
  2009. In fall 2009, the IMF allocated $186 million to Moldova to
  cover its immediate budgetary needs, and the government signed an
  new agreement with the IMF in January 2010 for a program worth $574
  million. In 2010, an upturn in the world economy boosted GDP growth
  to 3.1% and inflation to 7.3%. Economic reforms have been slow
  because of corruption and strong political forces backing government
  controls. Nevertheless, the government's primary goal of EU
  integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. The
  granting of EU trade preferences and increased exports to Russia
  will encourage higher growth rates, but the agreements are unlikely
  to serve as a panacea, given the extent to which export success
  depends on higher quality standards and other factors. The economy
  has made a modest recovery, but remains vulnerable to political
  uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic
  interests, higher fuel prices, poor agricultural weather, and the
  skepticism of foreign investors as well as the presence of an
  illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.</p>

<p id="id101134">Monaco<br/>

  Monaco, bordering France on the Mediterranean coast, is a<br/>

  popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant<br/>

  climate. The principality also is a major banking center and has<br/>

  successfully sought to diversify into services and small,<br/>

  high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income<br/>

  tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for<br/>

  individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies<br/>

  that have set up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a<br/>

  tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects<br/>

  stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they<br/>

  can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the<br/>

  principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD's "grey<br/>

  list" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues<br/>

  to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws<br/>

  and help combat tax evasion. The state retains monopolies in a<br/>

  number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the<br/>

  postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to<br/>

  those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101135" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Mongolia
  Economic activity in Mongolia has traditionally been based
  on herding and agriculture - Mongolia's extensive mineral deposits,
  however, have attracted foreign investors. The country holds copper,
  gold, coal, molybdenum, fluorspar, uranium, tin, and tungsten
  deposits, which account for a large part of foreign direct
  investment and government revenues. Soviet assistance, at its height
  one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at
  the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw
  Mongolia endure both deep recession, because of political inaction
  and natural disasters, as well as economic growth, because of
  reform-embracing, free-market economics and extensive privatization
  of the formerly state-run economy. Severe winters and summer
  droughts in 2000-02 resulted in massive livestock die-off and zero
  or negative GDP growth. This was compounded by falling prices for
  Mongolia's primary sector exports and widespread opposition to
  privatization. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely
  because of high copper prices and new gold production. In 2008
  Mongolia experienced a soaring inflation rate with year-to-year
  inflation reaching nearly 30% - the highest inflation rate in over a
  decade. By late 2008, as the country began to feel the effects of
  the global financial crisis, falling commodity prices helped lower
  inflation, but also reduced government revenues and forced cuts in
  spending. In early 2009, the International Monetary Fund reached a
  $236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia, and the country has
  started to move out of the crisis. Although the banking sector
  remains unstable, the government is now enforcing stricter
  supervision regulations. In October 2009, the government passed
  long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop
  Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi mine, considered to be one of the world's
  largest untapped copper deposits. The economy grew an estimated 7%
  in 2010, largely on the strength of exports to nearby countries, and
  international reserves reached $1.6 billion in September, an all
  time high for Mongolia. Mongolia's economy continues to be heavily
  influenced by its neighbors. Mongolia purchases 95% of its petroleum
  products and a substantial amount of electric power from Russia,
  leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Trade with China
  represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China
  receives about two-thirds of Mongolia's exports. Remittances from
  Mongolians working abroad are sizable, but have fallen due to the
  economic crisis; money laundering is a growing concern. Mongolia
  joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its
  participation in regional economic and trade regimes.</p>

<p id="id101136">Montenegro<br/>

  Montenegro severed its economy from federal control and<br/>

  from Serbia during the MILOSEVIC era and maintained its own central<br/>

  bank, adopted the Deutchmark, then the euro - rather than the<br/>

  Yugoslav dinar - as official currency, collected customs tariffs,<br/>

  and managed its own budget. The dissolution of the loose political<br/>

  union between Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate<br/>

  membership in several international financial institutions, such as<br/>

  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In January<br/>

  2007, Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro is<br/>

  pursuing its own membership in the World Trade Organization and<br/>

  signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European<br/>

  Union in October 2007. The European Council granted candidate<br/>

  country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session.<br/>

  Unemployment and regional disparities in development are key<br/>

  political and economic problems. Montenegro has privatized its large<br/>

  aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as well as most of its<br/>

  financial sector, and has begun to attract foreign direct investment<br/>

  in the tourism sector. The global financial crisis has had a<br/>

  significant negative impact on the economy, due to the ongoing<br/>

  credit crunch, a decline in the real estate sector, and a fall in<br/>

  aluminum exports.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101137">Montserrat<br/>

  Severe volcanic activity, which began in July 1995, has<br/>

  put a damper on this small, open economy. A catastrophic eruption in<br/>

  June 1997 closed the airports and seaports, causing further economic<br/>

  and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled<br/>

  the island. Some began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited<br/>

  the number. The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the<br/>

  lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops.<br/>

  Prospects for the economy depend largely on developments in relation<br/>

  to the volcanic activity and on public sector construction activity.<br/>

  The UK has launched a three-year $122.8 million aid program to help<br/>

  reconstruct the economy. Half of the island is expected to remain<br/>

  uninhabitable for another decade.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101138">Morocco<br/>

  Morocco's market economy benefits from the country's<br/>

  relatively low labor costs and proximity to Europe, which aid key<br/>

  areas of the economy such as agriculture, light manufacturing,<br/>

  tourism, and remittances. Morocco is also the world's largest<br/>

  exporter of phosphate, which has long provided a source of export<br/>

  earnings and economic stability. Economic policies pursued since<br/>

  2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the<br/>

  country with generally low inflation, improved financial<br/>

  performance, and steady progress in developing the service and<br/>

  industrial sectors. In 2006, Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement<br/>

  (FTA) with the US, and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in<br/>

  its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU. However, poverty,<br/>

  illiteracy, and unemployment rates remain high. In response to these<br/>

  challenges, King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for<br/>

  Human Development, a $2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty<br/>

  and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and<br/>

  replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing, among<br/>

  other policies. Morocco's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010,<br/>

  and reducing govenment spending and adapting to sluggish economic<br/>

  growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011. Morocco's long-term<br/>

  challenges include improving education and job prospects for young<br/>

  Moroccans, closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the<br/>

  poor, confronting corruption, and expanding and diversifying exports<br/>

  beyond phosphates and low-value-added products.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101139" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Mozambique
  At independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the
  world's poorest countries. Socialist mismanagement and a brutal
  civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the
  government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to
  stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance
  and with political stability since the multi-party elections in
  1994, have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth
  rate. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added
  tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the
  government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains,
  Mozambique remains dependent upon foreign assistance for more than
  half of its annual budget, and the majority of the population
  remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to
  employ the vast majority of the country's work force and smallholder
  agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak. A
  substantial trade imbalance persists although the opening of the
  Mozal aluminum smelter, the country's largest foreign investment
  project to date, has increased export earnings. At the end of 2007,
  and after years of negotiations, the government took over Portugal's
  majority share of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity (HCB) company, a
  dam that was not transferred to Mozambique at independence because
  of the ensuing civil war and unpaid debts. More power is needed for
  additional investment projects in titanium extraction and processing
  and garment manufacturing that could further close the import/export
  gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced
  through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily
  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is
  now at a manageable level. In July 2007 the Millennium Challenge
  Corporation (MCC) signed a Compact with Mozambique; the Compact
  entered into force in September 2008 and will continue for five
  years. Compact projects will focus on improving sanitation, roads,
  agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to
  spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country.
  Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 9% in the decade up to
  2007, one of Africa's strongest performances. However, heavy
  reliance on aluminum, which accounts for about one-third of exports,
  subjects the economy to volatile international prices. The sharp
  decline in aluminum prices during the global economic crisis lowered
  GDP growth by several percentage points. Despite 8.3% GDP growth in
  2010, the increasing cost of living prompted citizens to riot in
  September 2010, after bread price increases were announced. In an
  attempt to contain the cost of living, the government implemented
  subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal
  measures.</p>

<p id="id101140">Namibia<br/>

  The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction and<br/>

  processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 8% of GDP,<br/>

  but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich<br/>

  alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for<br/>

  gem-quality diamonds. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of<br/>

  nonfuel minerals in Africa, the world's fifth-largest producer of<br/>

  uranium, and the producer of large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,<br/>

  silver, and tungsten. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the<br/>

  population while about 35-40% of the population depends on<br/>

  subsistence agriculture for its livelihood. Namibia normally imports<br/>

  about 50% of its cereal requirements; in drought years food<br/>

  shortages are a major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP,<br/>

  relative to the region, hides one of the world's most unequal income<br/>

  distributions, as shown by Namibia's GINI coefficient. The Namibian<br/>

  economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar<br/>

  pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. Until 2010, Namibia<br/>

  drew 40% of its budget revenues from the Southern African Customs<br/>

  Union (SACU). Increased payments from SACU put Namibia's budget into<br/>

  surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence. SACU<br/>

  allotments to Namibia increased in 2009, but will drop for 2010 and<br/>

  2011 because South Africa went into recession during the global<br/>

  economic crisis, reducing overall SACU income. Increased fish<br/>

  production and mining of zinc, copper, uranium, and silver spurred<br/>

  growth in 2003-08, but growth in recent years was undercut by poor<br/>

  fish catches, higher costs of producing metals, and the global<br/>

  recession.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101141">Nauru<br/>

  Revenues of this tiny island have traditionally come from<br/>

  exports of phosphates now significantly depleted. An Australian<br/>

  company in 2005 entered into an agreement intended to exploit<br/>

  remaining supplies. Few other resources exist with most necessities<br/>

  being imported, mainly from Australia its former occupier and later<br/>

  major source of support. The rehabilitation of mined land and the<br/>

  replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term<br/>

  problems. Reserves of phosphates may only last until 2010 at current<br/>

  mining rates. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate<br/>

  deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in<br/>

  trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's<br/>

  economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds,<br/>

  the government faces virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government<br/>

  has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments.<br/>

  Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia's<br/>

  refugee processing center, making it almost totally dependent on<br/>

  food imports and foreign aid. Housing, hospitals, and other capital<br/>

  plant is deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the<br/>

  government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive<br/>

  statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru's GDP<br/>

  varying widely.<br/>

<p id="id101143">Nepal<br/>

  Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in<br/>

  the world, with almost one-quarter of its population living below<br/>

  the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,<br/>

  providing a livelihood for three-fourths of the population and<br/>

  accounting for about one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly<br/>

  involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses,<br/>

  jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope<br/>

  for exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000<br/>

  MW of feasible capacity, but political instability hampers foreign<br/>

  investment. Additional challenges to Nepal's growth include its<br/>

  landlocked geographic location, civil strife and labor unrest, and<br/>

  its susceptibility to natural disaster.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101144">Netherlands<br/>

  The Netherlands economy is noted for stable industrial<br/>

  relations, moderate unemployment and inflation, a sizable current<br/>

  account surplus, and an important role as a European transportation<br/>

  hub. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing,<br/>

  chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly<br/>

  mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force<br/>

  but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and<br/>

  for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners,<br/>

  began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country<br/>

  has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign<br/>

  direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the<br/>

  US. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the<br/>

  Netherlands' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign<br/>

  trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic<br/>

  crisis. Dutch GDP contracted 3.9% in 2009, while exports declined<br/>

  nearly 25% due to a sharp contraction in world demand. The Dutch<br/>

  financial sector has also suffered, due in part to the high exposure<br/>

  of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In response<br/>

  to turmoil in financial markets, the government nationalized two<br/>

  banks and injected billions of dollars into a third, to prevent<br/>

  further systemic risk. The government also sought to boost the<br/>

  domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering<br/>

  corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding<br/>

  export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts,<br/>

  however, resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6% of<br/>

  GDP in 2009 and 5.6% in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus<br/>

  of 0.7% of GDP in 2008. With unemployment weighing on private-sector<br/>

  consumption, the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely<br/>

  to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check<br/>

  while promoting economic recovery.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101145">New Caledonia<br/>

  New Caledonia has about 25% of the world's known<br/>

  nickel resources. Only a small amount of the land is suitable for<br/>

  cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition<br/>

  to nickel, substantial financial support from France - equal to more<br/>

  than 15% of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy.<br/>

  Substantial new investment in the nickel industry, combined with the<br/>

  recovery of global nickel prices, brightens the economic outlook for<br/>

  the next several years.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101146">New Zealand<br/>

  Over the past 20 years the government has transformed<br/>

  New Zealand from an agrarian economy dependent on concessionary<br/>

  British market access to a more industrialized, free market economy<br/>

  that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has boosted real<br/>

  incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and<br/>

  broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the<br/>

  industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years<br/>

  until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09.<br/>

  Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half<br/>

  of the decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that<br/>

  posed a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary pressures<br/>

  caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January<br/>

  2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08;<br/>

  international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further<br/>

  strengthened the currency and housing market, however, aggravating<br/>

  the current account deficit. The economy fell into recession before<br/>

  the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five<br/>

  consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the<br/>

  central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government<br/>

  developed fiscal stimulus measures. The economy posted a 1.7%<br/>

  decline in 2009, but pulled out of recession late in the year, and<br/>

  achieved 2.1% growth in 2010. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain<br/>

  vulnerable to weak external demand. The government plans to raise<br/>

  productivity growth and develop infrastructure, while reining in<br/>

  government spending.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101147">Nicaragua<br/>

  Nicaragua, the poorest country in Central America and the<br/>

  second poorest in the Hemisphere, has widespread underemployment and<br/>

  poverty. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has<br/>

  been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export<br/>

  opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles<br/>

  and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports, but<br/>

  increases in the minimum wage during the ORTEGA administration will<br/>

  likely erode its comparative advantage in this industry. ORTEGA's<br/>

  promotion of mixed business initiatives, owned by the Nicaraguan and<br/>

  Venezuelan state oil firms, together with the weak rule of law,<br/>

  could undermine the investment climate for domestic and<br/>

  international private firms in the near-term. Nicaragua relies on<br/>

  international economic assistance to meet internal- and<br/>

  external-debt financing obligations. Foreign donors have curtailed<br/>

  this funding, however, in response to November 2008 electoral fraud.<br/>

  Managua has an IMF extended Credit Facility program, which could<br/>

  help keep the government's fiscial deficit on target during the 2011<br/>

  election year and encourage transparency in the use of Venezuelan<br/>

  off-budget loans and assistance. In early 2004, Nicaragua secured<br/>

  some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily<br/>

  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, however, Managua still<br/>

  struggles with a high public debt burden. Nicaragua is gradually<br/>

  recovering from the global economic crisis as increased exports<br/>

  drove positive growth in 2010. The economy is expected to grow at a<br/>

  rate of about 3% in 2011.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101148">Niger<br/>

  Niger is a landlocked, Sub-Saharan nation, whose economy<br/>

  centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's<br/>

  largest uranium deposits. Drought, desertification, and strong<br/>

  population growth have undercut the economy. Niger shares a common<br/>

  currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank<br/>

  of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West<br/>

  African Monetary Union. In December 2000, Niger qualified for<br/>

  enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program<br/>

  for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement<br/>

  with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).<br/>

  Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative<br/>

  significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations,<br/>

  freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary<br/>

  education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other<br/>

  programs geared at poverty reduction. In December 2005, Niger<br/>

  received 100% multilateral debt relief from the IMF, which<br/>

  translates into the forgiveness of approximately US $86 million in<br/>

  debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. In<br/>

  2010, the Niger economy was recovering from the effects of a 2009<br/>

  drought that reduced grain and cowpea production and decimated<br/>

  livestock herds. The economy was also hurt when the international<br/>

  community cut off non-humanitarian aid in response to TANDJA's moves<br/>

  to extend his term as president. Nearly half of the government's<br/>

  budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be<br/>

  sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral<br/>

  resources.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101149">Nigeria<br/>

  Oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by political instability,<br/>

  corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and poor macroeconomic<br/>

  management but in 2008 began pursuing economic reforms. Nigeria's<br/>

  former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its<br/>

  overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides<br/>

  95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary<br/>

  revenues. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in<br/>

  August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the<br/>

  Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on<br/>

  economic reforms. Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April<br/>

  2002, after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets,<br/>

  making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris<br/>

  Club. In November 2005, Abuja won Paris Club approval for a<br/>

  debt-relief deal that eliminated $18 billion of debt in exchange for<br/>

  $12 billion in payments - a total package worth $30 billion of<br/>

  Nigeria's total $37 billion external debt. Since 2008 the government<br/>

  has begun to show the political will to implement the<br/>

  market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernizing the<br/>

  banking system, curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage<br/>

  demands, and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of<br/>

  earnings from the oil industry. GDP rose strongly in 2007-10 because<br/>

  of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010.<br/>

  President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of<br/>

  his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements.<br/>

  Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010<br/>

  JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes<br/>

  privatization of the state-run electricity generation and<br/>

  distribution facilities. The government also is working toward<br/>

  developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads. Nigeria's<br/>

  financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic<br/>

  crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to<br/>

  strengthen that sector.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101150">Niue<br/>

  The economy suffers from the typical Pacific island problems of<br/>

  geographic isolation, few resources, and a small population.<br/>

  Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall<br/>

  is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are<br/>

  used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government<br/>

  expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The<br/>

  agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening,<br/>

  although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists<br/>

  primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil,<br/>

  honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign<br/>

  collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent<br/>

  years has suffered a serious loss of population because of<br/>

  emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the<br/>

  promotion of tourism and financial services, although the<br/>

  International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination<br/>

  of all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid from New Zealand in<br/>

  FY08/09 was US$5.7 million. Niue suffered a devastating typhoon in<br/>

  January 2004, which decimated nascent economic programs. While in<br/>

  the process of rebuilding, Niue has been dependent on foreign aid.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101151">Norfolk Island<br/>

  Tourism, the primary economic activity, has steadily<br/>

  increased over the years and has brought a level of prosperity<br/>

  unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific islands. The agricultural<br/>

  sector has become self sufficient in the production of beef,<br/>

  poultry, and eggs.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101152">Northern Mariana Islands<br/>

  The economy benefits substantially from<br/>

  financial assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined<br/>

  as locally generated government revenues have grown. The key tourist<br/>

  industry employs about 50% of the work force and accounts for<br/>

  roughly one-fourth of GDP. Japanese tourists predominate. Annual<br/>

  tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years, but<br/>

  financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown.<br/>

  The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms<br/>

  producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Garment<br/>

  production is by far the most important industry with the employment<br/>

  of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US<br/>

  under duty and quota exemptions.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101153">Norway<br/>

  The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of welfare<br/>

  capitalism, featuring a combination of free market activity and<br/>

  government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as<br/>

  the vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state-majority-owned<br/>

  enterprises. The country is richly endowed with natural resources -<br/>

  petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly<br/>

  dependent on the petroleum sector, which accounts for nearly half of<br/>

  exports and over 30% of state revenue. Norway is the world's<br/>

  second-largest gas exporter; its position as an oil exporter has<br/>

  slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline. Norway<br/>

  opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994;<br/>

  nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it<br/>

  contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual<br/>

  declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves almost all state<br/>

  revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's second largest<br/>

  sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $500 billion in 2010. After<br/>

  lackluster growth of less than 1.5% in 2002-03, GDP growth picked up<br/>

  to 2.5-6.2% in 2004-07, partly due to higher oil prices. Growth fell<br/>

  to 1.8% in 2008, and the economy contracted by 1.4% in 2009 as a<br/>

  result of the slowing world economy and the drop in oil prices.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101154">Oman<br/>

  Oman is a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on<br/>

  dwindling oil resources. Because of declining reserves, Muscat has<br/>

  actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification,<br/>

  industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing<br/>

  the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by 2020. Tourism and<br/>

  gas-based industries are key components of the government's<br/>

  diversification strategy. By using enhanced oil recovery techniques,<br/>

  Oman succeeded in increasing oil production, giving the country more<br/>

  time to diversify, and the increase in global oil prices thoughout<br/>

  2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest<br/>

  in non-oil sectors.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101155">Pacific Ocean<br/>

  The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world<br/>

  economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.<br/>

  It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,<br/>

  extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals,<br/>

  and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60%<br/>

  of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation<br/>

  of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role<br/>

  in the energy supplies of the US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru.<br/>

  The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the<br/>

  wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has led to<br/>

  fluctuations in new drillings.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101156">Pakistan<br/>

  Pakistan, an impoverished and underdeveloped country, has<br/>

  suffered from decades of internal political disputes and low levels<br/>

  of foreign investment. Between 2001-07, however, poverty levels<br/>

  decreased by 10%, as Islamabad steadily raised development spending.<br/>

  Between 2004-07, GDP growth in the 5-8% range was spurred by gains<br/>

  in the industrial and service sectors - despite severe electricity<br/>

  shortfalls - but growth slowed in 2008-09 and unemployment rose.<br/>

  Inflation remains the top concern among the public, climbing from<br/>

  7.7% in 2007 to more than 13% in 2010. In addition, the Pakistani<br/>

  rupee has depreciated since 2007 as a result of political and<br/>

  economic instability. The government agreed to an International<br/>

  Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement in November 2008 in response to a<br/>

  balance of payments crisis, but during 2009-10 its current account<br/>

  strengthened and foreign exchange reserves stabilized - largely<br/>

  because of lower oil prices and record remittances from workers<br/>

  abroad. Record floods in July-August 2010 lowered agricultural<br/>

  output and contributed to a jump in inflation, and reconstruction<br/>

  costs will strain the limited resources of the government. Textiles<br/>

  account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, but Pakistan's<br/>

  failure to expand a viable export base for other manufactures has<br/>

  left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Other long<br/>

  term challenges include expanding investment in education,<br/>

  healthcare, and electricity production, and reducing dependence on<br/>

  foreign donors.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101157">Palau<br/>

  The economy consists primarily of tourism, subsistence<br/>

  agriculture, and fishing. The government is the major employer of<br/>

  the work force relying heavily on financial assistance from the US.<br/>

  The Compact of Free Association with the US, entered into after the<br/>

  end of the UN trusteeship on 1 October 1994, provided Palau with up<br/>

  to $700 million in US aid for the following 15 years in return for<br/>

  furnishing military facilities. Business and tourist arrivals<br/>

  numbered 85,000 in 2007. The population enjoys a per capita income<br/>

  roughly 50% higher than that of the Philippines and much of<br/>

  Micronesia. Long-run prospects for the key tourist sector have been<br/>

  greatly bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific, the<br/>

  rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries, and the<br/>

  willingness of foreigners to finance infrastructure development.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101158">Panama<br/>

  Panama's dollarized economy rests primarily on a<br/>

  well-developed services sector that accounts for three-quarters of<br/>

  GDP. Services include operating the Panama Canal, banking, the Colon<br/>

  Free Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and<br/>

  tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal<br/>

  expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be<br/>

  completed by 2014 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 25% of current<br/>

  GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's<br/>

  capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are now too large to<br/>

  transverse the transoceanic crossway, and should help to reduce the<br/>

  unemployment rate. The United States and China are the top users of<br/>

  the Canal. Panama also plans to construct a metro system in Panama<br/>

  City, valued at $1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014.<br/>

  Panama's aggressive infrastructure development projects will likely<br/>

  lead the economy to continued growth in 2011. Strong economic<br/>

  performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity as<br/>

  Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America.<br/>

  About 30% of the population lives in poverty, however, during<br/>

  TORRIJOS's term poverty was reduced from 40% to 30% and unemployment<br/>

  dropped from 12% to 6%. Not a CAFTA signatory, Panama in December<br/>

  2006 independently negotiated a free trade agreement with the US,<br/>

  which, when implemented, will help promote the country's economic<br/>

  growth. Seeking removal from the Organization of Economic<br/>

  Development's gray-list of tax havens, Panama has also recently<br/>

  signed various double taxation treaties with other nations.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101159" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Papua New Guinea
  Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
  resources, but exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain and
  the high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a
  subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mineral deposits,
  including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of
  export earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 227
  billion cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil
  company is constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production
  facility that could begin exporting in 2013 or 2014. As the largest
  investment project in the country's history, it has the potential to
  double GDP in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export
  revenue. The government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency
  and accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large
  LNG projects. The government of Prime Minister SOMARE has expended
  much of its energy remaining in power. He was the first prime
  minister ever to serve a full five-year term. The government has
  brought stability to the national budget, largely through
  expenditure control; however, it relaxed spending constraints in
  2006 and 2007 as elections approached. Numerous challenges still
  face the government, including providing physical security for
  foreign investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring
  integrity to state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by
  privatizing moribund state institutions, and balancing relations
  with Australia, its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural
  challenges could upend the economy including an HIV/AIDS epidemic,
  with the highest infection rate in all of East Asia and the Pacific,
  and chronic law and order and land tenure issues. The global
  financial crisis had little impact because of continued high demand
  for Papua New Guinea's commodities exports.</p>

<p id="id101160">Paracel Islands<br/>

  The islands have the potential for oil and gas<br/>

  development. Waters around the islands support commercial fishing,<br/>

  but the islands themselves are not populated on a permanent basis.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101161">Paraguay<br/>

  Landlocked Paraguay has a market economy distinguished by a<br/>

  large informal sector, featuring re-export of imported consumer<br/>

  goods to neighboring countries, as well as the activities of<br/>

  thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors. A large<br/>

  percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its<br/>

  living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis.<br/>

  Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic<br/>

  measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income<br/>

  has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003<br/>

  and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high<br/>

  prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based<br/>

  export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the<br/>

  world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and<br/>

  slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession.<br/>

  The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity<br/>

  prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by<br/>

  introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at<br/>

  a 6.5% level in 2010. Political uncertainty, corruption, limited<br/>

  progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the<br/>

  main obstacles to growth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101162">Peru<br/>

  Peru's economy reflects its varied geography - an arid coastal<br/>

  region, the Andes further inland, and tropical lands bordering<br/>

  Colombia and Brazil. Abundant mineral resources are found in the<br/>

  mountainous areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent<br/>

  fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy grew by more than 4% per year<br/>

  during the period 2002-06, with a stable exchange rate and low<br/>

  inflation. Growth jumped to 9% per year in 2007 and 2008, driven by<br/>

  higher world prices for minerals and metals and the government's<br/>

  aggressive trade liberalization strategies, but then fell to less<br/>

  than 1% in 2009 in the face of the world recession and lower<br/>

  commodity export prices. Growth resumed in 2010 at nearly 8%, due<br/>

  partly to increased exports. Peru's rapid expansion has helped to<br/>

  reduce the national poverty rate by about 15% since 2002, though<br/>

  underemployment remains high; inflation has trended downward in<br/>

  2009, to below the Central Bank's 1-3% target. Despite Peru's strong<br/>

  macroeconomic performance, overdependence on minerals and metals<br/>

  subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices, and poor<br/>

  infrastructure precludes the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal<br/>

  areas. Not all Peruvians therefore have shared in the benefits of<br/>

  growth and despite President GARCIA's pursuit of sound trade and<br/>

  macroeconomic policies, persistent inequality has cost him political<br/>

  support. Nevertheless, he remains committed to Peru's free-trade<br/>

  path. Since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the United<br/>

  States, Canada, Singapore, and China, concluded negotiations with<br/>

  the European Union, and begun trade talks with Korea, Japan, and<br/>

  others. The US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) entered into<br/>

  force 1 February 2009, opening the way to greater trade and<br/>

  investment between the two economies.<br/>

<p id="id101163">Philippines<br/>

  Philippine GDP grew nearly 7% in 2010. The economy<br/>

  weathered the 2008-09 global recession better than its regional<br/>

  peers due to minimal exposure to securities issued by troubled<br/>

  global financial institutions; lower dependence on exports;<br/>

  relatively resilient domestic consumption, supported by large<br/>

  remittances from four-to five-million overseas Filipino workers; and<br/>

  a growing business process outsourcing industry. Economic growth in<br/>

  the Philippines has averaged 4.5% per year since 2001, when former<br/>

  President MACAPAGAL-ARROYO took office. Despite this growth, poverty<br/>

  worsened during the term of MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, because of a high<br/>

  population growth rate and inequitable distribution of income.<br/>

  MACAPAGAL-ARROYO averted a fiscal crisis by pushing for new revenue<br/>

  measures and, until recently, tightening expenditures to address the<br/>

  government's yawning budget deficit and to reduce high debt and debt<br/>

  service ratios. But the government abandoned its 2008<br/>

  balanced-budget goal in order to help the economy weather the global<br/>

  financial and economic storm. The economy under AQUINO faces budget<br/>

  shortfalls in the near term, but has had little difficulty issuing<br/>

  debt both locally and internationally to finance the deficits.<br/>

  AQUINO's first budget emphasizes education and other social spending<br/>

  programs, relying on the private sector to finance important<br/>

  infrastructure projects. Weak tax collection in recent years limits<br/>

  the government's ability to address major challenges.<br/>

<p id="id101164">Pitcairn Islands<br/>

  The inhabitants of this tiny isolated economy exist<br/>

  on fishing, subsistence farming, handicrafts, and postage stamps.<br/>

  The fertile soil of the valleys produces a wide variety of fruits<br/>

  and vegetables, including citrus, sugarcane, watermelons, bananas,<br/>

  yams, and beans. Bartering is an important part of the economy. The<br/>

  major sources of revenue are the sale of postage stamps to<br/>

  collectors and the sale of handicrafts to passing ships. In October<br/>

  2004, more than one-quarter of Pitcairn's small labor force was<br/>

  arrested, putting the economy in a bind, since their services were<br/>

  required as lighter crew to load or unload passing ships.<br/>

<p id="id101165" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Poland
  Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization since
  1990 and today stands out as a success story among transition
  economies. Before 2009, GDP had grown about 5% annually, based on
  rising private consumption, a jump in corporate investment, and EU
  funds inflows. GDP per capita is still much below the EU average,
  but is similar to that of the three Baltic states. Since 2004, EU
  membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major
  boost to the economy. Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4% in October
  2008, but climbed back to 11.8% for the year 2010, exceeding the EU
  average by more than 2%. In 2008 inflation reached 4.2%, more than
  the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland's target range, but
  fell to 2.4% in 2010 due to global economic slowdown. Poland's
  economic performance could improve over the longer term if the
  country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and
  rail infrastructure and its business environment. An inefficient
  commercial court system, a rigid labor code, bureaucratic red tape,
  burdensome tax system, and persistent low-level corruption keep the
  private sector from performing up to its full potential. Rising
  demands to fund health care, education, and the state pension system
  caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9% of GDP in
  2010. The PO/PSL coalition government, which came to power in
  November 2007, plans to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has
  also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms,
  increase workforce participation, reduce public sector spending
  growth, lower taxes, and accelerate privatization. The government,
  however, has moved slowly on major reforms. The legislature passed a
  law significantly limiting early retirement benefits. A health-care
  bill also passed through the legislature, but the legislature failed
  to overturn a presidential veto.</p>

<p id="id101166">Portugal<br/>

  Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly<br/>

  service-based economy since joining the European Community in 1986.<br/>

  Over the past two decades, successive governments have privatized<br/>

  many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the<br/>

  economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The<br/>

  country qualified for the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and<br/>

  began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU<br/>

  member economies. Economic growth had been above the EU average for<br/>

  much of the 1990s, but fell back in 2001-08, shrank 2.6% in 2009,<br/>

  before growing 1% in 2010. GDP per capita stands at roughly<br/>

  two-thirds of the EU-27 average. A poor educational system and a<br/>

  rigid labor market have been obstacles to greater productivity and<br/>

  growth. Portugal also has been increasingly overshadowed by<br/>

  lower-cost producers in Central Europe and Asia as a target for<br/>

  foreign direct investment. Portugal's competitiveness problems, low<br/>

  growth prospects, and high levels of public debt have made it<br/>

  vulnerable to bond market turbulence. Lisbon is implementing<br/>

  austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit from 9.4% of GDP in<br/>

  2009 to 4.6% of GDP in 2011, but some investors have expressed<br/>

  concern about Portugal's ability to achieve these targets and cover<br/>

  its sovereign debt. Without the option for stimulus measures, the<br/>

  government is focusing instead on boosting exports and implementing<br/>

  labor market reforms to try to raise GDP growth and tackle<br/>

  Portugal's competitiveness problems, which may help mitigate<br/>

  investor concerns over time.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101167">Puerto Rico<br/>

  Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the<br/>

  Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has far surpassed<br/>

  agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income.<br/>

  Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US<br/>

  firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US<br/>

  minimum wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy<br/>

  production and other livestock products as the main source of income<br/>

  in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an<br/>

  important source of income with estimated arrivals of more than 3.6<br/>

  million tourists in 2008.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101168">Qatar<br/>

  Despite the global financial crisis, Qatar has prospered in<br/>

  the last several years - in 2010 Qatar had the world's highest<br/>

  growth rate. Qatari authorities throughout the crisis sought to<br/>

  protect the local banking sector with direct investments into<br/>

  domestic banks. GDP rebounded in 2010 largely due to the increase in<br/>

  oil prices. Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's<br/>

  nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and<br/>

  foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still<br/>

  account for more than 50% of GDP, roughly 85% of export earnings,<br/>

  and 70% of government revenues. Oil and gas have made Qatar the<br/>

  second highest per-capita income country - following Liechtenstein -<br/>

  and likely the country with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil<br/>

  reserves of 15 billion barrels should enable continued output at<br/>

  current levels for 37 years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas<br/>

  exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, about 14% of the world total and<br/>

  third largest in the world. Qatar's successful 2022 world cup bid<br/>

  will likely accelerate large-scale infrastructure projects such as<br/>

  Qatar's metro system and the Qatar-Bahrain causeway.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101169">Romania<br/>

  Romania, which joined the European Union on 1 January 2007,<br/>

  began the transition from Communism in 1989 with a largely obsolete<br/>

  industrial base and a pattern of output unsuited to the country's<br/>

  needs. The country emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year<br/>

  recession thanks to strong demand in EU export markets. Domestic<br/>

  consumption and investment have fueled strong GDP growth in recent<br/>

  years, but have led to large current account imbalances. Romania's<br/>

  macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a<br/>

  middle class and address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption<br/>

  and red tape continue to handicap its business environment.<br/>

  Inflation rose in 2007-08, driven in part by strong consumer demand<br/>

  and high wage growth, rising energy costs, a nation-wide drought<br/>

  affecting food prices, and a relaxation of fiscal discipline.<br/>

  Romania's GDP contracted markedly in the last quarter of 2008 as the<br/>

  country began to feel the effects of a global downturn in financial<br/>

  markets and trade, and GDP fell more than 7% in 2009, prompting<br/>

  Bucharest to seek a $26 billion emergency assistance package from<br/>

  the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders. Drastic austerity<br/>

  measures, as part of Romania's IMF-led agreement led to a further<br/>

  1.9% GDP contraction in 2010. The economy is expected to return to<br/>

  positive growth in 2011.<br/>

<p id="id101170" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Russia
  Russia has undergone significant changes since the collapse
  of the Soviet Union, moving from a globally-isolated,
  centrally-planned economy to a more market-based and
  globally-integrated economy. Economic reforms in the 1990s
  privatized most industry, with notable exceptions in the energy and
  defense-related sectors. The protection of property rights is still
  weak and the private sector remains subject to heavy state
  interference. Russian industry is primarily split between
  globally-competitive commodity producers - in 2009 Russia was the
  world's largest exporter of natural gas, the second largest exporter
  of oil, and the third largest exporter of steel and primary aluminum
  - and other less competitive heavy industries that remain dependent
  on the Russian domestic market. This reliance on commodity exports
  makes Russia vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the
  highly volatile swings in global commodity prices. The government
  since 2007 has embarked on an ambitious program to reduce this
  dependency and build up the country's high technology sectors, but
  with few results so far. The economy had averaged 7% growth since
  the 1998 Russian financial crisis, resulting in a doubling of real
  disposable incomes and the emergence of a middle class. The Russian
  economy, however, was one of the hardest hit by the 2008-09 global
  economic crisis as oil prices plummeted and the foreign credits that
  Russian banks and firms relied on dried up. The Central Bank of
  Russia spent one-third of its $600 billion international reserves,
  the world's third largest, in late 2008 to slow the devaluation of
  the ruble. The government also devoted $200 billion in a rescue plan
  to increase liquidity in the banking sector and aid Russian firms
  unable to roll over large foreign debts coming due. The economic
  decline bottomed out in mid-2009 and the economy began to grow in
  the first quarter of 2010. However, a severe drought and fires in
  central Russia reduced agricultural output, prompting a ban on grain
  exports for part of the year, and slowed growth in other sectors
  such as manufacturing and retail trade. Russia's long-term
  challenges include a shrinking workforce, a high level of
  corruption, difficulty in accessing capital for smaller, non-energy
  companies, and poor infrastructure in need of large investments.</p>

<p id="id101171">Rwanda<br/>

  Rwanda is a poor rural country with about 90% of the<br/>

  population engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture and some<br/>

  mineral and agro-processing. In 2008, minerals overtook coffee and<br/>

  tea as Rwanda's primary foreign exchange earner. The 1994 genocide<br/>

  decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the<br/>

  population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the<br/>

  country's ability to attract private and external investment.<br/>

  However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and<br/>

  rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded and<br/>

  inflation has been curbed. Nonetheless, a majority still live below<br/>

  the poverty line of 250 Rwandan francs per day (about US$0.43).<br/>

  Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not<br/>

  keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Rwanda continues to<br/>

  receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily<br/>

  Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06.<br/>

  Rwanda also received a Millennium Challenge Account Compact in 2008.<br/>

  Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the<br/>

  limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional<br/>

  trade. Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its<br/>

  budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners.<br/>

  The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce<br/>

  poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and<br/>

  domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms, although<br/>

  energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of<br/>

  adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to<br/>

  handicap growth. The global downturn hurt export demand and tourism,<br/>

  but economic growth is recovering, driven in large part by the<br/>

  services sector, and inflation has been contained. On the back of<br/>

  this growth, government is gradually ending its fiscal stimulus<br/>

  policy while protecting aid to the poor.<br/>
