  <body><p id="id101172">Saint Barthelemy<br/>

  The economy of Saint Barthelemy is based upon<br/>

  high-end tourism and duty-free luxury commerce, serving visitors<br/>

  primarily from North America. The luxury hotels and villas host<br/>

  70,000 visitors each year with another 130,000 arriving by boat. The<br/>

  relative isolation and high cost of living inhibits mass tourism.<br/>

  The construction and public sectors also enjoy significant<br/>

  investment in support of tourism. With limited fresh water<br/>

  resources, all food must be imported, as must all energy resources<br/>

  and most manufactured goods. Employment is strong and attracts labor<br/>

  from Brazil and Portugal.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101173">Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha<br/>

  The economy depends<br/>

  largely on financial assistance from the UK, which amounted to about<br/>

  $27 million in FY06/07 or more than twice the level of annual<br/>

  budgetary revenues. The local population earns income from fishing,<br/>

  raising livestock, and sales of handicrafts. Because there are few<br/>

  jobs, 25% of the work force has left to seek employment on Ascension<br/>

  Island, on the Falklands, and in the UK.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101174">Saint Kitts and Nevis<br/>

  The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is<br/>

  heavily dependent upon tourism revenues, which has replaced sugar,<br/>

  the traditional mainstay of the economy until the 1970s. Following<br/>

  the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after<br/>

  decades of losses of 3-4% of GDP annually. To compensate for<br/>

  employment losses, the government has embarked on a program to<br/>

  diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of<br/>

  the economy, such as tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and<br/>

  offshore banking. More than 200,000 tourists visited the islands in<br/>

  2009. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts<br/>

  and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts<br/>

  in tourism demand. The current government is constrained by one of<br/>

  the world's highest public debt burdens equivalent to roughly 185%<br/>

  of GDP, largely attributable to public enterprise losses.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101175">Saint Lucia<br/>

  The island nation has been able to attract foreign<br/>

  business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and<br/>

  tourism industries, with a surge in foreign direct investment in<br/>

  2006, attributed to the construction of several tourism projects.<br/>

  Although crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be<br/>

  grown for export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of<br/>

  income and the industry is the island's biggest employer. Tourism is<br/>

  the main source of foreign exchange, although tourism sector<br/>

  revenues declined with the global economic downturn as US and<br/>

  European travel dropped in 2009. The manufacturing sector is the<br/>

  most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is<br/>

  trying to revitalize the banana industry, although recent hurricanes<br/>

  have caused exports to contract. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a<br/>

  variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts,<br/>

  natural disasters, and dependence on foreign oil. The public<br/>

  debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77% and high debt servicing obligations<br/>

  constrain the KING administration's ability to respond to adverse<br/>

  external shocks. Economic fundamentals remain solid, even though<br/>

  unemployment needs to be reduced.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101176">Saint Martin<br/>

  The economy of Saint Martin centers around tourism with<br/>

  85% of the labor force engaged in this sector. Over one million<br/>

  visitors come to the island each year with most arriving through the<br/>

  Princess Juliana International Airport in Sint Maarten. No<br/>

  significant agriculture and limited local fishing means that almost<br/>

  all food must be imported. Energy resources and manufactured goods<br/>

  are also imported, primarily from Mexico and the United States.<br/>

  Saint Martin is reported to have the highest per capita income in<br/>

  the Caribbean.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101177">Saint Pierre and Miquelon<br/>

  The inhabitants have traditionally earned<br/>

  their livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets<br/>

  operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been<br/>

  declining, however, because of disputes with Canada over fishing<br/>

  quotas and a steady decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint<br/>

  Pierre. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the islands an<br/>

  exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding<br/>

  territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents only 25% of<br/>

  what France had sought. France heavily subsidizes the islands to the<br/>

  great betterment of living standards. The government hopes an<br/>

  expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects. Fish farming,<br/>

  crab fishing, and agriculture are being developed to diversify the<br/>

  local economy. Recent test drilling for oil may pave the way for<br/>

  development of the energy sector.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101178" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
  Success of the economy hinges upon
  seasonal variations in agriculture, tourism, and construction
  activity as well as remittance inflows. Much of the workforce is
  employed in banana production and tourism, but persistent high
  unemployment has prompted many to leave the islands. This
  lower-middle-income country is vulnerable to natural disasters -
  tropical storms wiped out substantial portions of crops in 1994,
  1995, and 2002. In 2008, the islands had more than 200,000 tourist
  arrivals, mostly to the Grenadines, a drop of nearly 20% from 2007.
  Saint Vincent is home to a small offshore banking sector and has
  moved to adopt international regulatory standards. The government's
  ability to invest in social programs and respond to external shocks
  is constrained by its high public debt burden, which was over 90% of
  GDP at the end of 2010. Following the global downturn, St. Vincent
  and the Grenadines saw an economic decline in 2009, after slowing
  since 2006, when GDP growth reached a 10-year high of nearly 7%. The
  GONSALVES administration is directing government resources to
  infrastructure projects, including a new international airport that
  is expected to be completed in 2011.</p>

<p id="id101179">Samoa<br/>

  The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on<br/>

  development aid, family remittances from overseas, agriculture, and<br/>

  fishing. The country is vulnerable to devastating storms.<br/>

  Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90%<br/>

  of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, and copra. The<br/>

  manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. One<br/>

  factory in the Foreign Trade Zone employs 3,000 people to make<br/>

  automobile electrical harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia.<br/>

  Tourism is an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 122,000<br/>

  tourists visited the islands in 2007. In late September 2009, an<br/>

  earthquake and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa, and<br/>

  nearby American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power<br/>

  generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The Samoan Government<br/>

  has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement<br/>

  of investment, and continued fiscal discipline, while at the same<br/>

  time protecting the environment. Observers point to the flexibility<br/>

  of the labor market as a basic strength for future economic<br/>

  advances. Foreign reserves are in a relatively healthy state, the<br/>

  external debt is stable, and inflation is low.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101180">San Marino<br/>

  San Marino's economy relies heavily on its tourism and<br/>

  banking industries, as well as on the manufacture and export of<br/>

  ceramics, clothing, fabrics, furniture, paints, spirits, tiles, and<br/>

  wine. The per capita level of output and standard of living are<br/>

  comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy, which<br/>

  supplies much of its food. San Marino boasts the world's longest<br/>

  life expectancy for men with 80 years. The economy benefits from<br/>

  foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low<br/>

  taxes on interest earnings. San Marino has recently faced increased<br/>

  international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax<br/>

  authorities and transparency within its own banking sector, which<br/>

  generates about one-fifth of the country's tax revenues. Italy's<br/>

  implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate<br/>

  untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from<br/>

  San Marino to Italy worth more than $4.5 billion. Such outflows,<br/>

  combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino's largest<br/>

  financial institution and the recent global economic downturn, have<br/>

  contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit. However,<br/>

  San Marino has no national debt, and an unemployment rate half the<br/>

  size of Italy's. The San Marino government has adopted measures to<br/>

  counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. San<br/>

  Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws<br/>

  with EU members and international standards. In September 2009, the<br/>

  OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to<br/>

  fully implement global tax standards.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101181">Sao Tome and Principe<br/>

  This small, poor island economy has become<br/>

  increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence in 1975. Cocoa<br/>

  production has substantially declined in recent years because of<br/>

  drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome and Principe has to import all<br/>

  fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial<br/>

  amount of food. Over the years, it has had difficulty servicing its<br/>

  external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt<br/>

  rescheduling. Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $200 million in<br/>

  debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor<br/>

  Countries (HIPC) program, which helped bring down the country's $300<br/>

  million debt burden. In August 2005, the government signed on to a<br/>

  new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program<br/>

  worth $4.3 million. Considerable potential exists for development of<br/>

  a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand<br/>

  facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to<br/>

  reduce price controls and subsidies. Potential exists for the<br/>

  development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe's<br/>

  territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being<br/>

  jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual<br/>

  production is at least several years off. The first production<br/>

  licenses were sold in 2004, though a dispute over licensing with<br/>

  Nigeria delayed the country's receipt of more than $20 million in<br/>

  signing bonuses for almost a year.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101182">Saudi Arabia<br/>

  Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong<br/>

  government controls over major economic activities. It possesses<br/>

  about 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the<br/>

  largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The<br/>

  petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80% of budget revenues, 45% of<br/>

  GDP, and 90% of export earnings. Saudi Arabia is encouraging the<br/>

  growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and<br/>

  to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing<br/>

  on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration,<br/>

  and petrochemical sectors. Almost 6 million foreign workers play an<br/>

  important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and<br/>

  service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment<br/>

  among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on<br/>

  employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the<br/>

  education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has<br/>

  substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most<br/>

  recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science<br/>

  and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As<br/>

  part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia<br/>

  acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of<br/>

  negotiations. The government has begun establishing six "economic<br/>

  cities" in different regions of the country to promote foreign<br/>

  investment and plans to spend $373 billion between 2010 and 2014 on<br/>

  social development and infrastructure projects to advance Saudi<br/>

  Arabia's economic development.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101183">Senegal<br/>

  Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance. The country's<br/>

  key export industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production,<br/>

  and commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and<br/>

  oil exploration projects. In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold<br/>

  and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the<br/>

  international donor community. Government price controls and<br/>

  subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy<br/>

  contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround,<br/>

  thanks to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging over<br/>

  5% annually during 1995-2008. Annual inflation had been pushed down<br/>

  to the single digits. The country was adversely affected by the<br/>

  global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2%. As a<br/>

  member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),<br/>

  Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a<br/>

  unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. High<br/>

  unemployment, however, continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee<br/>

  Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe. Under the<br/>

  IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief program,<br/>

  Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral,<br/>

  multilateral, and private-sector debt. In 2007, Senegal and the IMF<br/>

  agreed to a new, non-disbursing, Policy Support Initiative program<br/>

  which was completed in 2010. Senegal received its first disbursement<br/>

  from the $540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed<br/>

  in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development. In<br/>

  2010, the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts.<br/>

  The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote<br/>

  renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity, more protests<br/>

  are likely and economic activity will be hindered. During the year,<br/>

  bakers protested government price controls on bread. Foreign<br/>

  investment in Senegal is constrained by Senegal's business<br/>

  environment, which has slipped in recent years, and by perceptions<br/>

  of corruption.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101184">Serbia<br/>

  MILOSEVIC-era mismanagement of the economy, an extended<br/>

  period of international economic sanctions, and the damage to<br/>

  Yugoslavia's infrastructure and industry during the NATO airstrikes<br/>

  in 1999 left the economy only half the size it was in 1990. After<br/>

  the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in<br/>

  September 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition<br/>

  government implemented stabilization measures and embarked on a<br/>

  market reform program. After renewing its membership in the IMF in<br/>

  December 2000, Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate into the<br/>

  international community by rejoining the World Bank (IBRD) and the<br/>

  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Belgrade<br/>

  has made progress in trade liberalization and enterprise<br/>

  restructuring and privatization, including telecommunications and<br/>

  small- and medium-size firms. It has made some progress towards EU<br/>

  membership, signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with<br/>

  Brussels in May 2008, and with full implementation of the Interim<br/>

  Trade Agreement with the EU in February 2010. Serbia is also<br/>

  pursuing membership in the World Trade Organization. Reforms needed<br/>

  to ensure the country's long-term viability have largely stalled<br/>

  since the onset of the global financial crisis. Serbia is grappling<br/>

  with fallout from crisis, which has led to a sharp drop in exports<br/>

  to Western Europe and a decline in manufacturing output.<br/>

  Unemployment and limited export earnings remain ongoing political<br/>

  and economic problems. Serbia signed an augmented $4 billion Stand<br/>

  By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2009. IMF conditions on Serbia<br/>

  constrain the use of stimulus efforts to revive the economy, while<br/>

  Serbia's concerns about inflation and exchange rate stability<br/>

  preclude the use of expansionary monetary policy. Serbia's economy<br/>

  grew by 1.8% in 2010 after a 3% contraction in 2009 as a recovery in<br/>

  Western Europe began.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101185">Seychelles<br/>

  Since independence in 1976, per capita output in this<br/>

  Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the<br/>

  pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the<br/>

  upper-middle income group of countries. Growth has been led by the<br/>

  tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and<br/>

  provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna<br/>

  fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign<br/>

  investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time,<br/>

  the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by<br/>

  promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale<br/>

  manufacturing. GDP grew about 7-8% per year in 2006-07, driven by<br/>

  tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction. The Seychelles<br/>

  rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for<br/>

  years and fell by 10% in the first 9 months of 2007. Despite these<br/>

  actions, the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains<br/>

  and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks, a foreign<br/>

  exchange shortage, high inflation, large financing gaps, and the<br/>

  global recession. In July 2008 the government defaulted on a Euro<br/>

  amortizing note worth roughly US$80 million, leading to a<br/>

  downgrading of Seychelles credit rating, but in October 2010 the EU<br/>

  approved a $2.9 million grant as part of a larger four-year program<br/>

  for Seychelles. In response to Seychelles successful implementation<br/>

  of tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the IMF upgraded Seychelles<br/>

  to a three-year exteneded fund facility (EFF) of $31 million in<br/>

  December 2009. In 2008, GDP fell more than 1% due to declining<br/>

  tourism, but the economy recovered in 2009-10 with a notable<br/>

  increase in tourist numbers for 2010.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101186">Sierra Leone<br/>

  Sierra Leone is an extremely poor nation with<br/>

  tremendous inequality in income distribution. While it possesses<br/>

  substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, its<br/>

  physical and social infrastructure has yet to recover from the civil<br/>

  war, and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic<br/>

  development. Nearly half of the working-age population engages in<br/>

  subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the<br/>

  processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the<br/>

  domestic market. Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of<br/>

  hard currency earnings accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone's<br/>

  exports. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of<br/>

  domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from<br/>

  abroad, which is essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and<br/>

  supplement government revenues. The IMF has completed a Poverty<br/>

  Reduction and Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic<br/>

  growth and reduce inflation and in 2010 approved a new program worth<br/>

  $45 million over three years. Political stability has led to a<br/>

  revival of economic activity such as the rehabilitation of bauxite<br/>

  and rutile mining, which are set to benefit from planned tax<br/>

  incentives. A number of offshore oil discoveries were announced in<br/>

  2009 and 2010. The development on these reserves, which could be<br/>

  significant, is still several years away.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101187">Singapore<br/>

  Singapore has a highly developed and successful<br/>

  free-market economy. It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free<br/>

  environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of<br/>

  most developed countries. The economy depends heavily on exports,<br/>

  particularly in consumer electronics, information technology<br/>

  products, pharmaceuticals, and on a growing financial services<br/>

  sector. Real GDP growth averaged 6.9% between 2004 and 2008. The<br/>

  economy contracted 1.3% in 2009 as a result of the global financial<br/>

  crisis, but rebounded nearly 15% in 2010, on the strength of renewed<br/>

  exports. Over the longer term, the government hopes to establish a<br/>

  new growth path that focuses on raising productivity growth, which<br/>

  has sunk to 1% per year in the last decade. Singapore has attracted<br/>

  major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology<br/>

  production and will continue efforts to establish Singapore as<br/>

  Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101188">Sint Maarten<br/>

  The economy of Sint Maarten centers around tourism with<br/>

  nearly four-fifths of the labor force engaged in this sector. Over<br/>

  one million visitors come to the island each year - 1.3 million in<br/>

  2008 - with most arriving through the Princess Juliana International<br/>

  Airport. Cruise ships and yachts also call on Sint Maarten's<br/>

  numerous ports and harbors. No significant agriculture and limited<br/>

  local fishing means that almost all food must be imported. Energy<br/>

  resources and manufactured goods are also imported. Sint Maarten had<br/>

  the highest per capita income among the five islands that formerly<br/>

  comprised the Netherlands Antilles.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101189">Slovakia<br/>

  Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its<br/>

  separation from the Czech Republic in 1993. Reforms to the taxation,<br/>

  healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia to<br/>

  consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and<br/>

  to adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly<br/>

  complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands,<br/>

  and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom<br/>

  with business friendly policies such as labor market liberalization<br/>

  and a 19% flat tax. Foreign investment in the automotive and<br/>

  electronic sectors has been strong. Slovakia's economic growth<br/>

  exceeded expectations in 2001-08 despite the general European<br/>

  slowdown. Unemployment, at an unacceptable 18% in 2003-04, dropped<br/>

  to 7.7% in 2008 but remains the economy's Achilles heel. FICO's<br/>

  cabinet was careful to keep a lid on spending in order to meet euro<br/>

  adoption criteria and has focused on regulating energy and food<br/>

  prices instead. To maintain a stable operating environment for<br/>

  investors, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development<br/>

  advised the Slovak government to refrain from intervening in<br/>

  important sectors of the economy. However, Bratislava's approach to<br/>

  mitigating the economic slowdown has included substantial government<br/>

  intervention and the option to nationalize strategic companies.<br/>

  Slovakia was admitted to the euro zone in January 2009. RADICOVA's<br/>

  government, in power since July 2010, has allowed the budget deficit<br/>

  to rise slightly, to 8.2% of GDP in 2010. GDP fell nearly 5% in 2009<br/>

  before gaining back 4% in 2010, and unemployment rose above 12% in<br/>

  2010, as the global recession impacted many segments of the economy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101190">Slovenia<br/>

  Slovenia became the first 2004 European Union entrant to<br/>

  adopt the euro (on 1 January 2007) and has become a model of<br/>

  economic success and stability for the region. With the highest per<br/>

  capita GDP in Central Europe, Slovenia has excellent infrastructure,<br/>

  a well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the<br/>

  Balkans and Western Europe. Privatization has lagged since 2002, and<br/>

  the economy has one of highest levels of state control in the EU.<br/>

  Structural reforms to improve the business environment have allowed<br/>

  for somewhat greater foreign participation in Slovenia's economy and<br/>

  have helped to lower unemployment. In March 2004, Slovenia became<br/>

  the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to<br/>

  donor partner at the World Bank. In December 2007, Slovenia was<br/>

  invited to begin the accession process for joining the OECD. Despite<br/>

  its economic success, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovenia<br/>

  has lagged behind the region average, and taxes remain relatively<br/>

  high. Furthermore, the labor market is often seen as inflexible, and<br/>

  legacy industries are losing sales to more competitive firms in<br/>

  China, India, and elsewhere. In 2009, the world recession caused the<br/>

  economy to contract - through falling exports and industrial<br/>

  production - by more than 8%, and unemployment to rise above 9%.<br/>

  Although growth resumed in 2010, the unemployment rate continued to<br/>

  rise, topping 10%.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101191">Solomon Islands<br/>

  The bulk of the population depends on agriculture,<br/>

  fishing, and forestry for at least part of its livelihood. Most<br/>

  manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The<br/>

  islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead,<br/>

  zinc, nickel, and gold. Prior to the arrival of RAMSI, severe ethnic<br/>

  violence, the closing of key businesses, and an empty government<br/>

  treasury culminated in economic collapse. RAMSI's efforts to restore<br/>

  law and order and economic stability have led to modest growth as<br/>

  the economy rebuilds.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101192">Somalia<br/>

  Despite the lack of effective national governance, Somalia<br/>

  has maintained a healthy informal economy, largely based on<br/>

  livestock, remittance/money transfer companies, and<br/>

  telecommunications. Agriculture is the most important sector with<br/>

  livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and more than 50%<br/>

  of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent<br/>

  upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the<br/>

  population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are<br/>

  Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and<br/>

  machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial<br/>

  sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has<br/>

  largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Somalia's<br/>

  service sector also has grown. Telecommunication firms provide<br/>

  wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest<br/>

  international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a<br/>

  formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have<br/>

  sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in<br/>

  remittances annually. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of<br/>

  goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to<br/>

  operate and are supported with private-security militias. Due to<br/>

  armed attacks on and threats to humanitarian aid workers, the World<br/>

  Food Programme partially suspended its operations in southern<br/>

  Somalia in early January 2010 pending improvement in the security<br/>

  situation. Somalia's arrears to the IMF have continued to grow.<br/>

<p id="id101193">South Africa<br/>

  South Africa is a middle-income, emerging market with<br/>

  an abundant supply of natural resources; well-developed financial,<br/>

  legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors; a stock<br/>

  exchange that is the 18th largest in the world; and modern<br/>

  infrastructure supporting a relatively efficient distribution of<br/>

  goods to major urban centers throughout the region. At the end of<br/>

  2007, South Africa began to experience an electricity crisis. State<br/>

  power supplier Eskom encountered problems with aged plants,<br/>

  necessitating "load-shedding" cuts to residents and businesses in<br/>

  the major cities. Growth was robust from 2004 to 2007 as South<br/>

  Africa reaped the benefits of macroeconomic stability and a global<br/>

  commodities boom, but began to slow in the second half of 2007 due<br/>

  to the electricity crisis and the subsequent global financial<br/>

  crisis' impact on commodity prices and demand. GDP fell nearly 2% in<br/>

  2009. Unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has<br/>

  constrained growth. Daunting economic problems remain from the<br/>

  apartheid era - especially poverty, lack of economic empowerment<br/>

  among the disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of public<br/>

  transportation. South Africa's former economic policy was fiscally<br/>

  conservative, focusing on controlling inflation, and attaining a<br/>

  budget surplus. The current government largely follows the same<br/>

  prudent policies, but must contend with the impact of the global<br/>

  crisis and is facing growing pressure from special interest groups<br/>

  to use state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to<br/>

  low-income areas and to increase job growth. More than one-quarter<br/>

  of South Africa's population currently receives social grants.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101194">South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands<br/>

  Some fishing takes place in<br/>

  adjacent waters. There is a potential source of income from<br/>

  harvesting finfish and krill. The islands receive income from<br/>

  postage stamps produced in the UK, sale of fishing licenses, and<br/>

  harbor and landing fees from tourist vessels. Tourism from<br/>

  specialized cruise ships is increasing rapidly.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101195">Southern Ocean<br/>

  Fisheries in 2006-07 landed 126,976 metric tons, of<br/>

  which 82% (104,586 tons) was krill (Euphausia superba) and 9.5%<br/>

  (12,027 tons) Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides - also<br/>

  known as Chilean sea bass), compared to 127,910 tons in 2005-06 of<br/>

  which 83% (106,591 tons) was krill and 9.7% (12,396 tons) Patagonian<br/>

  toothfish (estimated fishing from the area covered by the Convention<br/>

  of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR),<br/>

  which extends slightly beyond the Southern Ocean area).<br/>

  International agreements were adopted in late 1999 to reduce<br/>

  illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 2000-01<br/>

  season landed, by one estimate, 8,376 metric tons of Patagonian and<br/>

  Antarctic toothfish. In the 2007-08 Antarctic summer, 45,213<br/>

  tourists visited the Southern Ocean, compared to 35,552 in<br/>

  2006-2007, and 29,799 in 2005-2006 (estimates provided to the<br/>

<p id="id101196" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Spain
  Spain's mixed capitalist economy is the 12th largest in the
  world, and its per capita income roughly matches that of Germany and
  France. However, after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth,
  the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a
  recession in the second quarter of 2008. GDP contracted by 3.7% in
  2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and by another 0.4% in 2010,
  making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global
  recession. The reversal in Spain's economic growth reflects a
  significant decline in the construction sector, an oversupply of
  housing, falling consumer spending, and slumping exports. Government
  efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending, extended
  unemployment benefits, and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp
  rise in the unemployment rate, which rose from a low of about 8% in
  2007 to 20% in 2010. The government budget deficit worsened from
  3.8% of GDP in 2008 to about 9.7% of GDP in 2010, more than three
  times the euro-zone limit. Spain's large budget deficit and poor
  economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial
  contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the
  government's efforts to cut spending, privatize industries, and
  boost competitiveness through labor market reforms. Spanish banks'
  high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate
  market also poses a continued risk for the sector. The government
  intervened in one regional savings bank in 2009, and investors
  remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled
  banks. The Bank of Spain, however, is seeking to boost confidence in
  the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their
  losses and consolidate into stronger groups.</p>

<p id="id101197">Spratly Islands<br/>

  Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing.<br/>

  The proximity to nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins<br/>

  suggests the potential for oil and gas deposits, but the region is<br/>

  largely unexplored. There are no reliable estimates of potential<br/>

  reserves. Commercial exploitation has yet to be developed.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101198">Sri Lanka<br/>

  Sri Lanka is engaging in large-scale reconstruction and<br/>

  development projects following the end of the 26-year conflict with<br/>

  the LTTE, including increasing electricity access and rebuilding its<br/>

  road and rail network. Additionally, Sri Lanka seeks to reduce<br/>

  poverty by using a combination of state directed policies and<br/>

  private investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas,<br/>

  develop small and medium enterprises, and promote increased<br/>

  agriculture, High levels of government funding may be difficult, as<br/>

  the government already is faced with high debt interest payments, a<br/>

  bloated civil service, and historically high budget deficits. The<br/>

  2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's<br/>

  economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments<br/>

  crisis, which was alleviated by a $2.6 billion IMF standby agreement<br/>

  in July 2009. The end of the civil war and the IMF loan, however,<br/>

  have largely restored investors' confidence, reflected in part by<br/>

  the Sri Lankan stock market's recognition as one of the best<br/>

  performing markets in the world. Sri Lankan growth rates averaged<br/>

  nearly 5% in during the war, but increased government spending on<br/>

  development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP<br/>

  growth to around 6-7% per year in 2006-08. After experiencing 3.5%<br/>

  growth in 2009, Sri Lanka's economy is poised to achieve high growth<br/>

  rates in the postwar period.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101199">Sudan<br/>

  Since 1997, Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement<br/>

  macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate<br/>

  and a large reserve of foreign exchange. A new currency, the<br/>

  Sudanese Pound, was introduced in January 2007 at an initial<br/>

  exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds. Sudan began<br/>

  exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy<br/>

  boomed on the back of increases in oil production, high oil prices,<br/>

  and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the<br/>

  second half of 2008. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two<br/>

  decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure<br/>

  in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on<br/>

  subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at<br/>

  or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in<br/>

  average per capita income. Sudan's real GDP expanded by 5.2% during<br/>

  2010, an improvement over 2009's 4.2% growth but significantly below<br/>

  the more that 10% per year growth experienced prior to the global<br/>

  financial crisis in 2006 and 2007. While the oil sector continues to<br/>

  drive growth, services and utilities play an increasingly important<br/>

  role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important<br/>

  as it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP.<br/>

  In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession, scheduled in<br/>

  January 2011, Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the<br/>

  black market with the Central Bank's official rate also losing value<br/>

  as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency. The<br/>

  Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to<br/>

  defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced<br/>

  a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard<br/>

  currency, but uncertainty ahead of the referendum has meant that<br/>

  foreign exchange remained in heavy demand as 2010 came to a close.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101200">Suriname<br/>

  The economy is dominated by the mining industry, with<br/>

  exports of alumina, gold, and oil accounting for about 85% of<br/>

  exports and 25% of government revenues, making the economy highly<br/>

  vulnerable to mineral price volatility. In 2000, the government of<br/>

  Ronald VENETIAAN, returned to office and inherited an economy with<br/>

  inflation of over 100% and a growing fiscal deficit. He quickly<br/>

  implemented an austerity program, raised taxes, attempted to control<br/>

  spending, and tamed inflation. Economic growth reached about 6% in<br/>

  2007 and 2008, owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and<br/>

  oil. Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold<br/>

  mining sectors from Netherlands, Belgium, and the European<br/>

  Development Fund. The economy contracted in 2009, however, as<br/>

  investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity<br/>

  exports when global prices for most commodities fell. Trade picked<br/>

  up, boosting Suriname's economic growth in 2010, but the<br/>

  government's budget remained strained, with increased social<br/>

  spending during last year's election. Suriname's economic prospects<br/>

  for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to<br/>

  responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of<br/>

  structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101201">Svalbard<br/>

  Coal mining, tourism, and international research are the<br/>

  major revenue sources on Svalbard. Coal mining is the dominant<br/>

  economic activity and a treaty of 9 February 1920 gave the 41<br/>

  signatories equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to<br/>

  Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal<br/>

  companies have mined in the past, the only companies still engaging<br/>

  in this are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are<br/>

  essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company<br/>

  employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs<br/>

  many of the local services, and provides most of the local<br/>

  infrastructure. There is also some hunting of seal, reindeer, and<br/>

  fox.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101202">Swaziland<br/>

  In this small, landlocked economy, subsistence agriculture<br/>

  occupies approximately 70% of the population. The manufacturing<br/>

  sector has diversified since the mid-1980s. Sugar and wood pulp<br/>

  remain important foreign exchange earners. In 2007, the sugar<br/>

  industry increased efficiency and diversification efforts, in<br/>

  response to a 17% decline in EU sugar prices. Mining has declined in<br/>

  importance in recent years with only coal and quarry stone mines<br/>

  remaining active. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short<br/>

  border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South<br/>

  Africa from which it receives more than nine-tenths of its imports<br/>

  and to which it sends 60% of its exports. Swaziland's currency is<br/>

  pegged to the South African rand, subsuming Swaziland's monetary<br/>

  policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African<br/>

  Customs Union (SACU) account for two-thirds of Swaziland's<br/>

  government revenues, and worker remittances from South Africa<br/>

  substantially supplement domestically earned income. Customs<br/>

  revenues plummeted during the global economic crisis and Swaziland<br/>

  has appealed to SACU for assistance. With an estimated 40%<br/>

  unemployment rate, Swaziland's need to increase the number and size<br/>

  of small and medium enterprises and attract foreign direct<br/>

  investment is acute. Overgrazing, soil depletion, drought, and<br/>

  sometimes floods persist as problems for the future. More than<br/>

  one-fourth of the population needed emergency food aid in 2006-07<br/>

  because of drought, and more than one-quarter of the adult<br/>

  population has been infected by HIV/AIDS.<br/>

<p id="id101203">Sweden<br/>

  Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole of the 20th<br/>

  century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a<br/>

  mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits.<br/>

  It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external<br/>

  communications, and a skilled labor force. In September 2003,<br/>

  Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned<br/>

  about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower,<br/>

  and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily<br/>

  oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for<br/>

  about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector<br/>

  accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for<br/>

  little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was<br/>

  in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased<br/>

  domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered<br/>

  the center-right government considerable scope to implement its<br/>

  reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare<br/>

  dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy.<br/>

  Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish<br/>

  economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth<br/>

  continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions<br/>

  reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities<br/>

  and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove the<br/>

  strong rebound in 2010.<br/>

<p id="id101204" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Switzerland
  Switzerland is a peaceful, prosperous, and modern market
  economy with low unemployment, a highly skilled labor force, and a
  per capita GDP among the highest in the world. Switzerland's economy
  benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial
  services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in
  high-technology, knowledge-based production. The Swiss have brought
  their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's, in
  order to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade
  protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural
  sector. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn
  put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand
  stalled. The Swiss National Bank during this period effectively
  implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the
  economy and prevent appreciation of the franc. Switzerland's economy
  grew 2.8% in 2010, when Bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus
  program, but its prized banking sector has recently faced
  significant challenges. The country's largest banks suffered sizable
  losses in 2008-09, leading its largest bank to accept a government
  rescue deal in late 2008. Switzerland has also come under increasing
  pressure from individual neighboring countries, the EU, the US, and
  international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws.
  Consequently, the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations
  on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion.
  The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with
  numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate the OECD
  standard, and it is working with Germany and the UK to resolve
  outsanding issues, particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on
  bank deposits held by foreigners. Parliament passed the first five
  double-taxation agreements, including that with the US, in March
  2010, but the agreements are subject to public referendum. In 2009,
  Swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to
  reveal at Washington's behest the names of US account-holders
  suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud. These steps will
  have a lasting impact on Switzerland's long history of bank secrecy.</p>

<p id="id101205">Syria<br/>

  Syrian economic growth slowed to 1.8% in 2009 as the global<br/>

  economic crisis affected oil prices and the economies of Syria's key<br/>

  export partners and sources of investment. Damascus has implemented<br/>

  modest economic reforms in the past few years, including cutting<br/>

  lending interest rates, opening private banks, consolidating all of<br/>

  the multiple exchange rates, raising prices on some subsidized<br/>

  items, most notably gasoline and cement, and establishing the<br/>

  Damascus Stock Exchange - which began operations in 2009. In<br/>

  addition, President ASAD signed legislative decrees to encourage<br/>

  corporate ownership reform, and to allow the Central Bank to issue<br/>

  Treasury bills and bonds for government debt. Nevertheless, the<br/>

  economy remains highly controlled by the government. Long-run<br/>

  economic constraints include declining oil production, high<br/>

  unemployment, rising budget deficits, and increasing pressure on<br/>

  water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population<br/>

  growth, industrial expansion, and water pollution.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101206" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Taiwan
  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with gradually
  decreasing government guidance of investment and foreign trade. In
  keeping with this trend, some large, state-owned banks and
  industrial firms have been privatized. Exports, led by electronics
  and machinery, generate about 70% of Taiwan's GDP growth, and have
  provided the primary impetus for economic development. This heavy
  dependence on exports makes the economy vulnerable to downturns in
  world demand. In 2009, Taiwan's GDP fell by 1.9%, due primarily to a
  20% year-on-year decline in exports. GDP grew more than 8% in 2010,
  as exports returned to the level of previous years. Taiwan's
  diplomatic isolation, low birth rate, and rapidly aging population
  are major long-term challenges. Free trade agreements have
  proliferated in East Asia over the past several years, but so far
  Taiwan has been excluded from this greater economic integration,
  largely for reasons of diplomacy. Taiwan's birth rate of only 1.2
  child per woman is among the lowest in the world, raising the
  prospect of future labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and
  declining tax revenues. Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with
  the number of people over 65 accounting for 10.8% of the island's
  total population as of the end of 2009. The island runs a large
  trade surplus, and its foreign reserves are the world's fourth
  largest, behind China, Japan, and Russia. Since President MA
  Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, cross-Strait economic ties have
  increased significantly. Since 2005 China has overtaken the US to
  become Taiwan's second-largest source of imports after Japan. China
  is also the island's number one destination for foreign direct
  investment. Taipei has focused much of its economic recovery effort
  on improving cross-Strait economic integration. Three financial
  memorandums of understanding, covering banking, securities, and
  insurance, took effect in mid-January 2010, opening the island to
  greater investments from the Mainland's financial firms and
  institutional investors, and providing new opportunities for Taiwan
  financial firms to operate in China. Taiwan and the mainland in June
  2010 signed the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
  (ECFA), an agreement similar to a free-trade agreement deal that
  will increase cross-Strait economic ties by lowering tariffs on a
  number of goods. Taiwan's goverment has said that the ECFA will
  serve as a stepping stone toward trade pacts with other regional
  partners and announced the beginning of negotiations on such an
  agreement with Singapore in August.</p>

<p id="id101207" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Tajikistan
  Tajikistan has one of the lowest per capita GDPs among
  the 15 former Soviet republics. Because of a lack of employment
  opportunities in Tajikistan, nearly half of the labor force works
  abroad, primarily in Russia and Kazakhstan, supporting families in
  Tajikistan through remittances. The exact number of labor migrants
  is unknown, but estimated at around 1 million. Less than 7% of the
  land area is arable. Cotton is the most important crop, but this
  sector is burdened with debt and obsolete infrastructure; moreover,
  government has encouraged a gradual transition away from cotton and
  towards food cultivation due to its concerns about feeding the
  population. Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and
  tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant,
  hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light
  industry and food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely
  damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp
  decline in industrial and agricultural production. Tajikistan's
  economic situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of
  structural reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power
  shortages, and the external debt burden. A debt restructuring
  agreement was reached with Russia in December 2002, including a $250
  million write-off of Tajikistan's $300 million debt. Completion of
  the Sangtuda I hydropower dam - finished in 2009 with Russian
  investment - and the Sangtuda II and Rogun dams will add
  substantially to electricity output. If finished according to Tajik
  plans, Rogun will be the world's tallest dam. The World Bank, in
  2010, agreed to fund safety and feasibility studies for the Rogun
  Dam. Favorable reports from these studies could increase investor
  interest in the project, which has been stalled due to lack of
  funding. Tajikistan has also received substantial infrastructure
  development loans from the Chinese government to improve roads and
  an electricity transmission network. To help increase north-south
  trade, the US funded a $36 million bridge which opened in August
  2007 and links Tajikistan and Afghanistan. While Tajikistan has
  experienced steady economic growth since 1997, more than half of the
  population continues to live in poverty. Economic growth reached
  10.6% in 2004, but dropped below 8% in 2005-08, as the effects of
  higher oil prices and then the international financial crisis began
  to register - mainly in the form of lower prices for key export
  commodities and lower remittances from Tajiks working abroad, due to
  the global economic downturn. In 2009 GDP growth dropped to 3.4% as
  a result of the world recession.</p>

<p id="id101208">Tanzania<br/>

  Tanzania is one of the world's poorest economies in terms<br/>

  of per capita income, however, Tanzania average 7% GDP growth per<br/>

  year between 2000 and 2008 on strong gold production and tourism.<br/>

  The economy depends heavily on agriculture, which accounts for more<br/>

  than one-fourth of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs about<br/>

  60% of the work force. The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors<br/>

  have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging economic<br/>

  infrastructure, including rail and port infrastructure that are<br/>

  important trade links for inland countries. Recent banking reforms<br/>

  have helped increase private-sector growth and investment, and the<br/>

  government has increased spending on agriculture to 7% of its<br/>

  budget. Continued donor assistance and solid macroeconomic policies<br/>

  supported a positive growth rate, despite the world recession. In<br/>

  2008, Tanzania received the world's largest Millennium Challenge<br/>

  Compact grant, worth $698 million. Dar es Salaam used fiscal<br/>

  stimulus and loosened monitary policy to ease the impact of the<br/>

  global recession. GDP growth in 2009-10 was a respectable 6% per<br/>

  year due to high gold prices and increased production.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101209">Thailand<br/>

  With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise<br/>

  economy, generally pro-investment policies, and strong export<br/>

  industries, Thailand enjoyed solid growth from 2000 to 2008 -<br/>

  averaging more than 4% per year - as it recovered from the Asian<br/>

  financial crisis of 1997-98. Thai exports - mostly machinery and<br/>

  electronic components, agricultural commodities, and jewelry -<br/>

  continue to drive the economy, accounting for more than half of GDP.<br/>

  The global financial crisis of 2008-09 severely cut Thailand's<br/>

  exports, with most sectors experiencing double-digit drops. In 2009,<br/>

  the economy contracted 2.2%. In 2010, Thailand's economy expanded<br/>

  7.6%, its fastest pace since 1995, as exports rebounded from their<br/>

  depressed 2009 level. Antigovernment protests during March-May and<br/>

  the country's polarized political situation had - at most - a<br/>

  temporary impact on business and consumer confidence. Although<br/>

  tourism was hit hard during the protests, its quick recovery helped<br/>

  boost consumer confidence to new highs. Moreover, business and<br/>

  investor sentiment remained buoyant as Thailand's stock market grew<br/>

  almost 5% during the three-month period. The economy probably will<br/>

  continue to experience high grow well into 2011.<br/>

  In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure<br/>

  of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and<br/>

  anti-independence militias. Three hundred thousand people fled<br/>

  westward. Over the next three years a massive international program,<br/>

  manned by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police<br/>

  officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural<br/>

  areas. By the end of 2005, refugees had returned or had settled in<br/>

  Indonesia. The country continues to face great challenges in<br/>

  rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil<br/>

  administration, and generating jobs for young people entering the<br/>

  work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore<br/>

  waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This<br/>

  technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create<br/>

  jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities<br/>

  in Timor. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005, the National<br/>

  Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to<br/>

  serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the<br/>

  value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The<br/>

  Fund held assets of US$5.3 billion as of October 2009. The economy<br/>

  has been little impacted by the global financial crisis and<br/>

  continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence<br/>

  and civil unrest, which disrupted both private and public sector<br/>

  economic activity. The government in 2008 resettled tens of<br/>

  thousands of an estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons<br/>

  (IDPs); most IDPs returned home by early 2009. The underlying<br/>

  economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use<br/>

  oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth<br/>

  path and to reduce poverty.<br/>

<p id="id101211">Togo<br/>

  This small, sub-Saharan economy suffers from anemic economic<br/>

  growth and depends heavily on both commercial and subsistence<br/>

  agriculture, which provides employment for 65% of the labor force.<br/>

  Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and<br/>

  cotton generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the<br/>

  most important cash crop. Togo is the world's fourth-largest<br/>

  producer of phosphate. The government's decade-long effort,<br/>

  supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic<br/>

  reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in<br/>

  line with expenditures has moved slowly. Progress depends on follow<br/>

  through on privatization, increased openness in government financial<br/>

  operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued<br/>

  support from foreign donors. Togo is on track with its IMF Extended<br/>

  Credit Facility and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in<br/>

  2010 at which 95% of the country's debt was forgiven. Economic<br/>

  growth prospects remain marginal due to declining cotton production<br/>

  and underinvestment in phosphate mining.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101212">Tokelau<br/>

  Tokelau's small size (three villages), isolation, and lack<br/>

  of resources greatly restrain economic development and confine<br/>

  agriculture to the subsistence level. The people rely heavily on aid<br/>

  from New Zealand - about $10 million annually in 2008 and 2009 - to<br/>

  maintain public services. New Zealand's support amounts to 80% of<br/>

  Tokelau's recurrent government budget. An international trust fund,<br/>

  currently worth nearly US$32 million, was established in 2004 to<br/>

  provide Tokelau an independent source of revenue. The principal<br/>

  sources of revenue come from sales of copra, postage stamps,<br/>

  souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also remitted to families<br/>

  from relatives in New Zealand.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101213">Tonga<br/>

  Tonga has a small, open, South Pacific island economy. It has<br/>

  a narrow export base in agricultural goods. Squash, vanilla beans,<br/>

  and yams are the main crops. Agricultural exports, including fish,<br/>

  make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a high<br/>

  proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The country remains<br/>

  dependent on external aid and remittances from Tongan communities<br/>

  overseas to offset its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest<br/>

  source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had<br/>

  39,000 visitors in 2006. The government is emphasizing the<br/>

  development of the private sector, especially the encouragement of<br/>

  investment, and is committing increased funds for health and<br/>

  education. Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and<br/>

  well developed social services. High unemployment among the young, a<br/>

  continuing upturn in inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and<br/>

  rising civil service expenditures are major issues facing the<br/>

  government.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101214">Trinidad and Tobago<br/>

  Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as<br/>

  an excellent investment site for international businesses and has<br/>

  one of the highest growth rates and per capita incomes in Latin<br/>

  America. Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly<br/>

  over 8%, significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for<br/>

  that same period; however, GDP has slowed down since then and<br/>

  contracted about 3.5% in 2009, before rising more than 2% in 2010.<br/>

  Growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas<br/>

  (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical,<br/>

  aluminum, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.<br/>

  Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and<br/>

  gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but<br/>

  it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and<br/>

  beverages, as well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas<br/>

  account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of<br/>

  employment. The country is also a regional financial center, and<br/>

  tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important<br/>

  domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy<br/>

  benefits from a growing trade surplus. The previous MANNING<br/>

  administration benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic<br/>

  export sector; however, declines in oil and gas prices have reduced<br/>

  government revenues which will challenge the new government's<br/>

  commitment to maintaining high levels of public investment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101215">Tunisia<br/>

  Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural,<br/>

  mining, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Governmental control of<br/>

  economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the<br/>

  past decade with increasing privatization, simplification of the tax<br/>

  structure, and a prudent approach to debt. Progressive social<br/>

  policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia<br/>

  relative to the region. Real growth, which averaged almost 5% over<br/>

  the past decade, declined to 4.6% in 2008 and to 3-4% in 2009-10<br/>

  because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in<br/>

  Europe - Tunisia's largest export market. However, development of<br/>

  non-textile manufacturing, a recovery in agricultural production,<br/>

  and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the<br/>

  economic effect of slowing exports. Tunisia will need to reach even<br/>

  higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities<br/>

  for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing<br/>

  population of university graduates. The challenges ahead include:<br/>

  privatizing industry, liberalizing the investment code to increase<br/>

  foreign investment, improving government efficiency, reducing the<br/>

  trade deficit, and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the<br/>

  impoverished south and west.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101216" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Turkey
  Turkey's economy is increasingly driven by its industry and
  service sectors, although its traditional agriculture sector still
  accounts for about 30% of employment. An aggressive privatization
  program has reduced state involvement in basic industry, banking,
  transport, and communication, and an emerging cadre of middle-class
  entrepreneurs is adding a dynamism to the economy. Turkey's
  traditional textiles and clothing clothing sectors still account for
  one-third of industrial employment, despite stiff competition in
  international markets that resulted from the end of the global quota
  system. Other sectors, notably the automotive, construction, and
  electronics industries, are rising in importance and have surpassed
  textiles within Turkey's export mix. Oil began to flow through the
  Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006, marking a major milestone
  that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to
  market. Several gas pipelines also are being planned to help move
  Central Asian gas to Europe via Turkey, which will help address
  Turkey's dependence on energy imports over the long term. After
  Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara adopted
  financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The reforms
  strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in an
  era of strong growth - averaging more than 6% annually until 2009,
  when global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy slowed
  growth to 4.7%, reduced inflation to 6.5% - a 34-year low - and cut
  the public sector debt-to-GPD ratio below 50%. Turkey's
  well-regulated financial markets and banking system weathered the
  global financial crisis and GDP rebounded strongly to 7.3% in 2010,
  as exports returned to normal levels following the recession. The
  economy, however, continues to be burdened by a high current account
  deficit and remains dependent on often volatile, short-term
  investment to finance its trade deficit. The stock value of FDI
  stood at $174 billion at year-end 2010, but inflows have slowed
  considerably in light of continuing economic turmoil in Europe, the
  source of much of Turkey's FDI. Further economic and judicial
  reforms and prospective EU membership are expected to boost Turkey's
  attractiveness to foreign investors. However, Turkey's relatively
  high current account deficit, uncertainty related to policy-making,
  and fiscal imbalances leave the economy vulnerable to destabilizing
  shifts in investor confidence.</p>

<p id="id101217" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Turkmenistan
  Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive
  agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources.
  The two largest crops are cotton, most of which is produced for
  export, and wheat, which is domestically consumed. Although
  agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, it continues to employ
  nearly half of the country's workforce. With an authoritarian
  ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure,
  Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform,
  hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its
  inefficient economy. Privatization goals remain limited. From
  1998-2005, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate
  export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive
  short-term external debt. At the same time, however, total exports
  rose by an average of roughly 15% per year from 2003-08, largely
  because of higher international oil and gas prices. New pipelines to
  China and Iran, that began operation in late 2009 and early 2010,
  have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas,
  although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export
  revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia.
  Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of
  widespread internal poverty, endemic corruption, a poor educational
  system, government misuse of oil and gas revenues, and Ashgabat's
  reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms. In the past,
  Turkmenistan's economic statistics were state secrets. The new
  government has established a State Agency for Statistics, but GDP
  numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error. In
  particular, the rate of GDP growth is uncertain. Since his election,
  President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country's dual currency
  exchange rate, ordered the redenomination of the manat, reduced
  state subsidies for gasoline, and initiated development of a special
  tourism zone on the Caspian Sea. Although foreign investment is
  encouraged, numerous bureaucratic obstacles impede international
  business activity.</p>

<p id="id101218">Turks and Caicos Islands<br/>

  The Turks and Caicos economy is based on<br/>

  tourism, offshore financial services, and fishing. Most capital<br/>

  goods and food for domestic consumption are imported. The US is the<br/>

  leading source of tourists, accounting for more than three-quarters<br/>

  of the 175,000 visitors that arrived in 2004. Major sources of<br/>

  government revenue also include fees from offshore financial<br/>

  activities and customs receipts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101219" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Tuvalu
  Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered group of
  nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known mineral
  resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon
  imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the
  primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average,
  visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public
  sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the
  adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad, and
  remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $2
  million in 2007. Substantial income is received annually from the
  Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in
  1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and
  South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative
  withdrawals, this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an
  estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TTF contributed nearly
  $9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important
  cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US
  Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of
  payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure
  financial stability and sustainability, the government is pursuing
  public sector reforms, including privatization of some government
  functions and personnel cuts. Tuvalu also derives royalties from the
  lease of its ".tv" Internet domain name with revenue of more than $2
  million in 2006. A minor source of government revenue comes from the
  sale of stamps and coins. With merchandise exports only a fraction
  of merchandise imports, continued reliance must be placed on fishing
  and telecommunications license fees, remittances from overseas
  workers, official transfers, and income from overseas investments.
  Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to
  climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation.</p>
