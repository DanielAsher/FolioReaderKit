  Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile
  soils, regular rainfall, small deposits of copper, gold, and other
  minerals, and recently discovered oil. Uganda has never conducted a
  national minerals survey. Agriculture is the most important sector
  of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee
  accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government
  - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies -
  has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
  currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing
  prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The
  policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and
  boosting production and export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms
  ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued
  investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
  exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return
  of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Uganda has received about $2
  billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief. In 2007 Uganda
  received $10 million for a Millennium Challenge Account Threshold
  Program. The global economic downturn has hurt Uganda's exports;
  however, Uganda's GDP growth is still relatively strong due to past
  reforms and sound management of the downturn. Oil revenues and taxes
  will become a larger source of government funding as oil comes on
  line in the next few years. Instability in southern Sudan is the
  biggest risk for the Ugandan economy in 2011 because Uganda's main
  export partner is Sudan and Uganda is a key destination for Sudanese
  refugees.</p>

<p id="id101221" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Ukraine
  After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the
  most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
  producing about four times the output of the next-ranking republic.
  Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet
  agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
  of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise,
  its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for
  example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and
  mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the
  former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991, the
  Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
  framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform
  within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform
  efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to
  less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for
  energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have
  made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine
  depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and
  natural gas requirements and 100% of its nuclear fuel needs. After a
  two-week dispute that saw gas supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine
  agreed to ten-year gas supply and transit contracts with Russia in
  January 2009 that brought gas prices to "world" levels. The strict
  terms of the contracts have further hobbled Ukraine's cash-strapped
  state gas company, Naftohaz. Outside institutions - particularly the
  IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of
  reforms. Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and
  customs privileges in a March 2005 budget law, bringing more
  economic activity out of Ukraine's large shadow economy, but more
  improvements are needed, including fighting corruption, developing
  capital markets, and improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's
  economy was buoyant despite political turmoil between the prime
  minister and president until mid-2008. Real GDP growth exceeded 7%
  in 2006-07, fueled by high global prices for steel - Ukraine's top
  export - and by strong domestic consumption, spurred by rising
  pensions and wages. Ukraine reached an agreement with the IMF for a
  $16.4 billion Stand-By Arrangement in November 2008 to deal with the
  economic crisis, but the Ukrainian Government's lack of progress in
  implementing reforms has twice delayed the release of IMF assistance
  funds. The drop in steel prices and Ukraine's exposure to the global
  financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing lowered growth
  in 2008 and the economy contracted more than 15% in 2009, among the
  worst economic performances in the world; growth resumed in 2010,
  buoyed by exports. External conditions are likely to hamper efforts
  for economic recovery in 2011.</p>

<p id="id101222">United Arab Emirates<br/>

  The UAE has an open economy with a high per<br/>

  capita income and a sizable annual trade surplus. Successful efforts<br/>

  at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on<br/>

  oil and gas output to 25%. Since the discovery of oil in the UAE<br/>

  more than 30 years ago, the UAE has undergone a profound<br/>

  transformation from an impoverished region of small desert<br/>

  principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The<br/>

  government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure<br/>

  expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector<br/>

  involvement. In April 2004, the UAE signed a Trade and Investment<br/>

  Framework Agreement with Washington and in November 2004 agreed to<br/>

  undertake negotiations toward a Free Trade Agreement with the US,<br/>

  however, those talks have not moved forward. The country's Free<br/>

  Trade Zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are<br/>

  helping to attract foreign investors. The global financial crisis,<br/>

  tight international credit, and deflated asset prices slowed GDP<br/>

  growth in 2010. UAE authorities tried to blunt the crisis by<br/>

  increasing spending and boosting liquidity in the banking sector.<br/>

  The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it was heavily exposed to depressed<br/>

  real estate prices. Dubai lacked sufficient cash to meet its debt<br/>

  obligations, prompting global concern about its solvency. The UAE<br/>

  Central Bank and Abu Dhabi-based banks bought the largest shares. In<br/>

  December 2009 Dubai received an additional $10 billion loan from the<br/>

  emirate of Abu Dhabi. The economy is expected to continue a slow<br/>

  rebound. Dependence on oil, a large expatriate workforce, and<br/>

  growing inflation pressures are significant long-term challenges.<br/>

  The UAE's strategic plan for the next few years focuses on<br/>

  diversification and creating more opportunities for nationals<br/>

  through improved education and increased private sector employment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101223">United Kingdom<br/>

  The UK, a leading trading power and financial center,<br/>

  is the third largest economy in Europe after Germany and France.<br/>

  Over the past two decades, the government has greatly reduced public<br/>

  ownership and contained the growth of social welfare programs.<br/>

  Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by<br/>

  European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with less than<br/>

  2% of the labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil<br/>

  resources, but its oil and natural gas reserves are declining and<br/>

  the UK became a net importer of energy in 2005. Services,<br/>

  particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account by<br/>

  far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to<br/>

  decline in importance. After emerging from recession in 1992,<br/>

  Britain's economy enjoyed the longest period of expansion on record<br/>

  during which time growth outpaced most of Western Europe. In 2008,<br/>

  however, the global financial crisis hit the economy particularly<br/>

  hard, due to the importance of its financial sector. Sharply<br/>

  declining home prices, high consumer debt, and the global economic<br/>

  slowdown compounded Britain's economic problems, pushing the economy<br/>

  into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompting the then<br/>

  BROWN government to implement a number of measures to stimulate the<br/>

  economy and stabilize the financial markets; these include<br/>

  nationalizing parts of the banking system, cutting taxes, suspending<br/>

  public sector borrowing rules, and moving forward public spending on<br/>

  capital projects. Facing burgeoning public deficits and debt levels,<br/>

  the CAMERON government in 2010 initiiated a five-year austerity<br/>

  program, which aims to lower London's budget deficit from over 11%<br/>

  of GDP in 2010 to nearly 1% by 2015. The Bank of England<br/>

  periodically coordinates interest rate moves with the European<br/>

  Central Bank, but Britain remains outside the European Economic and<br/>

  Monetary Union (EMU).<br/>

<p id="id101224" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">United States
  The US has the largest and most technologically
  powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $47,400. In
  this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms
  make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments
  buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private
  marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their
  counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand
  capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new
  products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to enter their
  rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US
  firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,
  especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military
  equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War
  II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
  development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the
  bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of
  those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay
  raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975,
  practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top
  20% of households. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led
  coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required
  major shifts in national resources to the military. Soaring oil
  prices between 2005 and the first half of 2008 threatened inflation
  and unemployment, as higher gasoline prices ate into consumers'
  budgets. Imported oil accounts for about 60% of US consumption.
  Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic
  infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging
  population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of
  family income in the lower economic groups. The merchandise trade
  deficit reached a record $840 billion in 2008 before shrinking to
  $506 billion in 2009, and ramping back up to $630 billion in 2010.
  The global economic downturn, the sub-prime mortgage crisis,
  investment bank failures, falling home prices, and tight credit
  pushed the United States into a recession by mid-2008. GDP
  contracted until the third quarter of 2009, making this the deepest
  and longest downturn since the Great Depression. To help stabilize
  financial markets, the US Congress established a $700 billion
  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008. The government
  used some of these funds to purchase equity in US banks and other
  industrial corporations, much of which had been returned to the
  government by early 2011. In January 2009 the US Congress passed and
  President Barack OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787
  billion fiscal stimulus to be used over 10 years - two-thirds on
  additional spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and
  to help the economy recover. Approximately two-thirds of these funds
  were injected into the economy by the end of 2010. In March 2010,
  President OBAMA signed a health insurance reform bill into law that
  will extend coverage to an additional 32 million American citizens
  by 2016, through private health insurance for the general population
  and Medicaid for the impoverished. In July 2010, the president
  signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
  Act, a bill designed to promote financial stability by protecting
  consumers from financial abuses, ending taxpayer bailouts of
  financial firms, dealing with troubled banks that are "too big to
  fail," and improving accountability and transparency in the
  financial system - in particular, by requiring certain financial
  derivatives to be traded in markets that are subject to government
  regulation and oversight. In late 2010, the US Federal Reserve Bank
  (The Fed) announced that it would purchase $600 billion worth of US
  Government bonds by June 2011, in an attempt to keep interest rates
  from rising and snuffing out the nascent recovery.</p>

<p id="id101226">Uruguay<br/>

  Uruguay's economy is characterized by an export-oriented<br/>

  agricultural sector, a well-educated work force, and high levels of<br/>

  social spending. After averaging growth of 5% annually during<br/>

  1996-98, in 1999-2002 the economy suffered a major downturn,<br/>

  stemming largely from the spillover effects of the economic problems<br/>

  of its large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil. In 2001-02, Argentine<br/>

  citizens made massive withdrawals of dollars deposited in Uruguayan<br/>

  banks after bank deposits in Argentina were frozen, which led to a<br/>

  plunge in the Uruguayan peso, a banking crisis, and a sharp economic<br/>

  contraction. Real GDP fell in four years by nearly 20%, with 2002<br/>

  the worst year. The unemployment rate rose, inflation surged, and<br/>

  the burden of external debt doubled. Financial assistance from the<br/>

  IMF helped stem the damage. Uruguay restructured its external debt<br/>

  in 2003 without asking creditors to accept a reduction on the<br/>

  principal. Economic growth for Uruguay resumed, and averaged 8%<br/>

  annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial<br/>

  crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated<br/>

  to 2.9% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a<br/>

  recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher<br/>

  public expenditure and investment, and GDP growth exceeded 7% in<br/>

  2010.<br/>

<p id="id101227" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Uzbekistan
  Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country; 11% of the land
  is intensely cultivated, in irrigated river valleys. More than 60%
  of the population lives in densely populated rural communities.
  Export of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and petroleum,
  provided about 40% of foreign exchange earnings in 2009. Other major
  export earners include gold and cotton. Uzbekistan is now the
  world's second-largest cotton exporter and fifth largest producer;
  it has come under increasing international criticism for the use of
  child labor in its annual cotton harvest. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan
  enjoyed a bumper cotton crop in 2010 amidst record high prices.
  Following independence in September 1991, the government sought to
  prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight
  controls on production and prices. While aware of the need to
  improve the investment climate, the government still sponsors
  measures that often increase, not decrease, its control over
  business decisions. A sharp increase in the inequality of income
  distribution has hurt the lower ranks of society since independence.
  In 2003, the government accepted Article VIII obligations under the
  IMF, providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict
  currency controls and tightening of borders have lessened the
  effects of convertibility and have also led to some shortages that
  have further stifled economic activity. The Central Bank often
  delays or restricts convertibility, especially for consumer goods.
  Potential investment by Russia and China in Uzbekistan's gas and oil
  industry, as well as increased cooperation with South Korea in the
  realm of civil aviation, may boost growth prospects. However,
  decreased demand for natural gas in Europe and Russia in the wake of
  the global financial crisis could reduce energy-related revenues in
  the near term. In November 2005, Russian President Vladimir PUTIN
  and Uzbekistan President KARIMOV signed an "alliance," which
  included provisions for economic and business cooperation. Russian
  businesses have shown increased interest in Uzbekistan, especially
  in mining, telecom, and oil and gas. In 2006, Uzbekistan took steps
  to rejoin the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the
  Eurasian Economic Community (EurASEC), which it subsequently left in
  2008, both organizations dominated by Russia. In the past Uzbek
  authorities had accused US and other foreign companies operating in
  Uzbekistan of violating Uzbek tax laws and have frozen their assets,
  but no new expropriations occurred in 2008-09. Instead, the Uzbek
  Government has actively courted several major U.S. and international
  corporations, offering attractive financing and tax advantages, and
  has landed a significant US investment in the automotive industry.
  Although growth slowed in 2009-10, Uzbekistan has seen few other
  effects from the global economic downturn, primarily due to its
  relative isolation from the global financial markets.</p>

<p id="id101228">Vanuatu<br/>

  This South Pacific island economy is based primarily on<br/>

  small-scale agriculture, which provides a living for about<br/>

  two-thirds of the population. Fishing, offshore financial services,<br/>

  and tourism, with nearly 197,000 visitors in 2008, are other<br/>

  mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the<br/>

  country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry<br/>

  sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from<br/>

  import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on<br/>

  relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural<br/>

  disasters, and long distances from main markets and between<br/>

  constituent islands. In response to foreign concerns, the government<br/>

  has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center.<br/>

  In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism<br/>

  through improved air connections, resort development, and cruise<br/>

  ship facilities. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a<br/>

  second target for growth. Australia and New Zealand are the main<br/>

  suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101229" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Venezuela
  Venezuela remains highly dependent on oil revenues, which
  account for roughly 95% of export earnings, about 55% of the federal
  budget revenues, and around 30% of GDP. A nationwide strike between
  December 2002 and February 2003 had far-reaching economic
  consequences - real GDP declined by around 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003
  - but economic output since then has recovered strongly. Fueled by
  high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP by
  about 10% in 2006, 8% in 2007, and nearly 5% in 2008, before a sharp
  drop in oil prices caused a contraction in 2009-10. This spending,
  combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to
  domestic credit, has created a consumption boom but has come at the
  cost of higher inflation - roughly 32% in 2008, and slowing only
  slightly to 30% in 2010, despite the lengthy downturn. Imports also
  jumped significantly before the recession of 2009. President Hugo
  CHAVEZ's continued efforts to increase the government's control of
  the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial,
  construction, oil, and steel sectors have hurt the private
  investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed
  non-petroleum exports. In the first half of 2010 Venezuela faced the
  prospect of lengthy nationwide blackouts when its main hydroelectric
  power plant - which provides more than 35% of the country's
  electricity - nearly shut down. In January, 2010, CHAVEZ announced a
  dual exchange rate system for the bolivar and closed the unofficial
  foreign exchange market - the "parallel" market - in an effort to
  stem inflation and slow the currency's depreciation. The foreign
  exchange system offers a 2.6 bolivar per dollar rate for imports of
  essentials, including food, medicine, and industrial machinery, and
  a 4.3 bolivar per dollar rate for imports of other products,
  including cars and telephones.</p>

<p id="id101230" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Vietnam
  Vietnam is a densely-populated developing country that in
  the last 30 years has had to recover from the ravages of war, the
  loss of financial support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the
  rigidities of a centrally-planned economy. Vietnamese authorities
  have reaffirmed their commitment to economic liberalization and
  international integration. They have moved to implement the
  structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce
  more competitive export-driven industries. Vietnam joined the WTO in
  January 2007 following more than a decade-long negotiation process.
  WTO membership has provided Vietnam an anchor to the global market
  and reinforced the domestic economic reform process. Agriculture's
  share of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in
  2000 to about 21% in 2009. Deep poverty has declined significantly
  and Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a
  labor force that is growing by more than one million people every
  year. The global recession has hurt Vietnam's export-oriented
  economy with GDP growing less than the 7% per annum average achieved
  during the last decade. In 2009 exports fell nearly 10%
  year-on-year, prompting the government to consider adjustments to
  tariffs to limit the trade deficit. The government has used stimulus
  spending, including a subsidized lending program, to help the
  economy through the global financial crisis. Vietnam's managed
  currency, the dong, faced downward pressure during the recession and
  the government devalued it by nearly 7% in December 2009. Foreign
  donors pledged $8 billion in new development assistance for 2010.
  Export growth resumed in 2010, driving GDP upward. However, Hanoi
  has struggled to control one of the region's highest inflation
  rates, which stands at 11.1% with interest hikes and multiple
  devaluations of the dong. Vietnam's economy faces higher lending
  rates, additional IMF scrutiny, domestic inflationary pressures, and
  an underperforming stock market.</p>

<p id="id101231">Virgin Islands<br/>

  Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting<br/>

  for 80% of GDP and employment. The islands hosted 2.4 million<br/>

  visitors in 2008. The manufacturing sector consists of petroleum<br/>

  refining, rum distilling, textiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals,<br/>

  and watch assembly. One of the world's largest petroleum refineries<br/>

  is at Saint Croix. The agricultural sector is small, with most food<br/>

  being imported. International business and financial services are<br/>

  small but growing components of the economy. The islands are<br/>

  vulnerable to substantial damage from storms. The government is<br/>

  working to improve fiscal discipline, to support construction<br/>

  projects in the private sector, to expand tourist facilities, to<br/>

  reduce crime, and to protect the environment.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101232">Wake Island<br/>

<p id="id101233">Wallis and Futuna<br/>

  The economy is limited to traditional subsistence<br/>

  agriculture, with about 80% of labor force earnings from agriculture<br/>

  (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing.<br/>

  About 4% of the population is employed in government. Revenues come<br/>

  from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to<br/>

  Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from expatriate<br/>

  workers in New Caledonia.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101234">West Bank<br/>

  The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the<br/>

  Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic<br/>

  growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid, the<br/>

  Palestinian Authority's (PA) implementation of economic and security<br/>

  reforms, and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by<br/>

  the Israeli Government. Nevertheless, overall standard-of-living<br/>

  measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second<br/>

  intifada in 2000. The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a<br/>

  result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement<br/>

  and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli<br/>

  security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows,<br/>

  industrial capacity, and basic commerce, both external and internal.<br/>

  Since 2008, the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister<br/>

  Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of<br/>

  institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and<br/>

  economic performance, supported by more than $3 billion in direct<br/>

  foreign donor assistance to the PA's budget since 2007. An easing of<br/>

  some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since<br/>

  2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger<br/>

  cities. The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West<br/>

  Bank remain Palestinians' lack of access to land and resources in<br/>

  Israeli-controlled areas, import and export restrictions, and a<br/>

  high-cost capital structure. Absent robust private sector growth,<br/>

  the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary<br/>

  needs.<br/>

<p id="id101235">Western Sahara<br/>

  Western Sahara has a small market-based economy whose<br/>

  main indutries are fishing, phosphate mining, and pastoral nomadism.<br/>

  The territory's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture<br/>

  difficult, and Wstern Sahara imports much of its food. The Moroccan<br/>

  Government administers Western Sahara's economy and is a source of<br/>

  employment, infrstructure development, and social spending in the<br/>

  territory. Western Sahara's unresolved legal status makes the<br/>

  exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between<br/>

  Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a<br/>

  four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast<br/>

  of Morocco, including the disputed waters off the coast of Western<br/>

  Sahara. Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially<br/>

  significant quantities, but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled<br/>

  over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration<br/>

  in the territory. Western Sahara's main long-term economic challenge<br/>

  is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of<br/>

  providing greater employment and income to the territory.<br/>

<p id="id101236" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">World
  In 2010, world output - and per capita income - began to
  recover from the 2008-09 recession, the first global downturn since
  1946. Gross World Product (GWP) grew 4.6%, largely on the strength
  of rebounding exports, which rose about 20% from the level of 2009.
  Growth was not evenly distributed across countries, however. Lower
  income countries - those with per capita incomes below $30,000 per
  year - averaged 6.3% growth, while higher income countries - with
  per capita incomes above $30,000 - averaged just 2.8% growth. And
  countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0% growth, while
  those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4% growth. Among
  large economies, China (+10.1%), Taiwan (+8.3%), India (+8.3%),
  Brazil (+7.5%), and South Korea (+6.1%) recorded the biggest GDP
  gains - China also became the world's largest exporter. Continuing
  uncertainties in mortgage and financial markets resulted in slower
  growth in Japan (+3.0%), the US (+2.8%), and the European Union
  (+1.7%). In 2010, global unemployment continued to creep upwards,
  reaching 8.8% - underemployment, especially in the developing world,
  remained much higher. Global gross fixed investment stabilized at
  about 23% of GWP, after a significant drop in 2009. World trade
  appears to be returning to pre-2009 patterns, with current account
  surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries. World
  external debt, however, dropped again in 2010 - about 5% from the
  2009 level, as many countries reduced borrowing. Many, if not most,
  countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. The
  global money supply, both narrowly and broadly defined, increased
  roughly 10%, as countries tried to keep interest rates low; the
  global budget deficit stablilized at roughly $3.5 trillion, as
  countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt.
  The international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world
  economy with a major new challenge, together with several
  long-standing ones. The fiscal stimulus packages put in place in
  2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits - government
  balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries.
  Treasuries issued new public debt - totaling $5.5 trillion since
  2008 - to pay for the additional expenditures. To keep interest
  rates low, many central banks monetized that debt, injecting large
  sums of money into the economies. As economic activity picks up,
  central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation
  without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further
  growth. At the same time, governments will face the difficult task
  of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their
  economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and
  financial stability.
  Long-standing challenges the world faces are several. The addition
  of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is
  exacerbating the problems of underemployment, pollution,
  waste-disposal, epidemics, water-shortages, famine, over-fishing of
  oceans, deforestation, desertification, and depletion of
  non-renewable resources. The nation-state, as a bedrock
  economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
  international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
  Internally, central governments often find their control over
  resources slipping as separatist regional movements - typically
  based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in many of the successor
  states of the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in
  India, in Iraq, in Indonesia, and in Canada. Externally, central
  governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international
  bodies, most notably the EU. The introduction of the euro as the
  common currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999, while
  paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse, poses economic
  risks because the participating nations are culturally and
  politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of
  income, and hence, differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies.
  In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem
  of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
  increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment.
  Because of their own internal problems and priorities, the
  industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal
  effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least from
  an economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized. The
  terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 accentuated a
  growing risk to global prosperity, illustrated, for example, by the
  reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist
  programs. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan added new uncertainties to
  global economic prospects.
  Despite these challenges, the world economy also shows great
  promise. Technology has made possible further advances in all
  fields, from agriculture, to medicine, alternative energy,
  metallurgy, and transportation. Improved global communications have
  greatly reduced the costs of international trade, helping the world
  gain from the international division of labor, raise living
  standards, and reduce income disparities among nations. Much of the
  resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial
  crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in
  concert to stem the financial onslaught, knowing well the lessons of
  past economic failures.</p>

<p id="id101237">Yemen<br/>

  Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on<br/>

  declining oil resources for revenue. Petroleum accounts for roughly<br/>

  25% of GDP and 70% of government revenue. Yemen has tried to counter<br/>

  the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its<br/>

  economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is<br/>

  designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign<br/>

  investment. In October 2009, Yemen exported its first liquefied<br/>

  natural gas as part of this diversification effort. In January 2010,<br/>

  the international community established the Friends of Yemen group<br/>

  that aims to support Yemen's efforts towards economic and political<br/>

  reform, and in August 2010 the IMF approved a three-year $370<br/>

  million program to further this effort. Despite these ambitious<br/>

  endeavors, Yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges,<br/>

  including declining water resources and a high population growth<br/>

  rate.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101238">Zambia<br/>

  Zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent<br/>

  years, with real GDP growth in 2005-08 about 6% per year.<br/>

  Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved<br/>

  the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the<br/>

  industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to<br/>

  return to profitability and spur economic growth. Copper output has<br/>

  increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and<br/>

  foreign investment. In 2005, Zambia qualified for debt relief under<br/>

  the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, consisting of<br/>

  approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief. Poverty remains a<br/>

  significant problem in Zambia, despite a stronger economy. Declining<br/>

  world commodity prices and demand slowed GDP growth in 2008, but a<br/>

  sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped Zambia<br/>

  recover. Lack of economic diversity subjects Zambia to fluctuations<br/>

  in copper prices and in the weather.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id101239">Zimbabwe<br/>

  The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of<br/>

  difficult economic problems. Its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in<br/>

  the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of<br/>

  dollars from the economy. The government's land reform program,<br/>

  characterized by chaos and violence, has badly damaged the<br/>

  commercial farming sector, the traditional source of exports and<br/>

  foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs, turning Zimbabwe<br/>

  into a net importer of food products. The EU and the US provide food<br/>

  aid on humanitarian grounds. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of<br/>

  Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing<br/>

  hyperinflation. The power-sharing government formed in February 2009<br/>

  has led to some economic improvements, including the cessation of<br/>

  hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and<br/>

  removing price controls. The economy is registering its first growth<br/>

  in a decade, but will be reliant on further political improvement<br/>

  for greater growth.<br/>
