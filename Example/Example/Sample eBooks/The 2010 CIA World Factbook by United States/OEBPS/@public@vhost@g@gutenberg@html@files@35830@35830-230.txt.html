<p id="id111435" style="margin-top: 2em">Field Listing :: Trafficking in persons</p>

<p id="id111436" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%">  Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who
  are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation.
  The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged
  with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection
  issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in
  forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude,
  and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a
  multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and
  freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown,
  inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human
  capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000,
  the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act
  (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the
  US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad.
  One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department
  of State's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the
  government response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150
  countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across
  their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or
  obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the
  annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts
  to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are
  those listed in the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2
  Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following tier rating definitions:
  Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making
  significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:
  1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,
  2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  combat trafficking in persons, or,
  3. they have committed to take action over the next year.
  Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the
  elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to
  do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential
  non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.
  Country</p>

<p id="id111437" style="margin-top: 2em">  Trafficking in persons</p>

<p id="id111438">Algeria<br/>

  current situation: Algeria is a transit country for men and<br/>

  women trafficked from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe for the purposes<br/>

  of commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude;<br/>

  criminal networks of sub-Saharan nationals in southern Algeria<br/>

  facilitate transit by arranging transportation, forged documents,<br/>

  and promises of employment<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Algeria is placed on the Tier 2<br/>

  Watch List because it does not fully comply with the minimum<br/>

  standards for the elimination of trafficking, however, it is making<br/>

  significant efforts to do so; in January 2009, the government<br/>

  approved new legislation that criminalizes trafficking in persons<br/>

  for the purposes of labor and sexual exploitation representing an<br/>

  important step toward complying with international standards;<br/>

  despite these efforts, the government did not show overall progress<br/>

  in punishing trafficking crimes and protecting trafficking victims<br/>

  and continued to lack adequate measures to protect victims and<br/>

  prevent trafficking (2009)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111439">Azerbaijan<br/>

  current situation: Azerbaijan is primarily a source and<br/>

  transit country for men, women, and children trafficked for the<br/>

  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; women<br/>

  and some children from Azerbaijan are trafficked to Turkey and the<br/>

  UAE for the purpose of sexual exploitation; men and boys are<br/>

  trafficked to Russia for the purpose of forced labor; Azerbaijan<br/>

  serves as a transit country for victims from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,<br/>

  Kazakhstan, and Moldova trafficked to Turkey and the UAE for sexual<br/>

  exploitation<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Azerbaijan is on the Tier 2 Watch<br/>

  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to<br/>

  combat trafficking in persons, particularly efforts to investigate,<br/>

  prosecute, and punish traffickers; to address complicity among law<br/>

  enforcement personnel; and to adequately identify and protect<br/>

  victims in Azerbaijan; the government has yet to develop a<br/>

  much-needed mechanism to identify potential trafficking victims and<br/>

  refer them to safety and care; poor treatment of trafficking victims<br/>

  in courtrooms continues to be a problem (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111440">Bangladesh<br/>

  current situation: Bangladesh is a source and transit<br/>

  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of<br/>

  forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; a significant share<br/>

  of Bangladesh's trafficking victims are men recruited for work<br/>

  overseas with fraudulent employment offers who are subsequently<br/>

  exploited under conditions of forced labor or debt bondage; children<br/>

  are trafficked within Bangladesh for commercial sexual exploitation,<br/>

  bonded labor, and forced labor; women and children from Bangladesh<br/>

  are also trafficked to India and Pakistan for sexual exploitation<br/>

  tier rating: Bangladesh is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because it<br/>

  does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination<br/>

  of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so,<br/>

  including some progress in addressing sex trafficking; the<br/>

  government did not demonstrate sufficient progress in criminally<br/>

  prosecuting and convicting labor trafficking offenders, particularly<br/>

  those responsible for the recruitment of Bangladeshi workers for the<br/>

  purpose of labor trafficking (2009)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111441">Belize<br/>

  current situation: Belize is a source, transit, and<br/>

  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the<br/>

  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; the<br/>

  most common form of trafficking in Belize is the internal sex<br/>

  trafficking of minors; some Central American men, women, and<br/>

  children, particularly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador,<br/>

  migrate voluntarily to Belize in search of work but are subsequently<br/>

  subjected to conditions of forced labor or forced prostitution<br/>

  tier rating: Belize is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because it does<br/>

  not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of<br/>

  trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so;<br/>

  despite efforts to raise public awareness of human trafficking and<br/>

  provide protection services for trafficking victims, the government<br/>

  did not show evidence of progress in convicting and sentencing<br/>

  trafficking offenders last year (2009)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111442">Burma<br/>

  current situation: Burma is a source country for women,<br/>

  children, and men trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and<br/>

  commercial sexual exploitation; Burmese women and children are<br/>

  trafficked to East and Southeast Asia for commercial sexual<br/>

  exploitation, domestic servitude, and forced labor; Burmese children<br/>

  are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Thailand as hawkers<br/>

  and beggars; women are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation<br/>

  to Malaysia and China; some trafficking victims transit Burma from<br/>

  Bangladesh to Malaysia and from China to Thailand; Burma's internal<br/>

  trafficking remains the most serious concern occurring primarily<br/>

  from villages to urban centers and economic hubs for labor in<br/>

  industrial zones, agricultural estates, and commercial sexual<br/>

  exploitation; the Burmese military continues to engage in the<br/>

  unlawful conscription of child soldiers, and continues to be the<br/>

  main perpetrator of forced labor inside Burma; ethnic insurgent<br/>

  groups also used compulsory labor of adults and unlawful recruitment<br/>

  of children; the regime's widespread use of and lack of<br/>

  accountability in forced labor and recruitment of child soldiers is<br/>

  particularly worrying and represents the top causal factor for<br/>

  Burma's significant trafficking problem<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 3 - serious problems remain in Burma, and in some<br/>

  areas, most notably in the area of forced labor, the Government of<br/>

  Burma is not making significant efforts to comply with the minimum<br/>

  standards for the elimination of trafficking, warranting a ranking<br/>

  of Tier 3; in other areas, particularly with regard to international<br/>

  sex trafficking of women and girls, the Government of Burma is<br/>

  making significant efforts (2010)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111443">Cameroon<br/>

  current situation: Cameroon is a source, transit, and<br/>

  destination country for women and children trafficked for the<br/>

  purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; most<br/>

  victims are children trafficked within country, with girls primarily<br/>

  trafficked for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation; both boys<br/>

  and girls are also trafficked within Cameroon for forced labor in<br/>

  sweatshops, bars, restaurants, and on tea and cocoa plantations;<br/>

  political will to eliminate slavery and trafficking has stalled; law<br/>

  enforcement efforts to address human trafficking including<br/>

  traditional slavery practices decreased (2009)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111467">Moldova<br/>

  current situation: Moldova is a major source and, to a<br/>

  lesser extent, a transit country for women and girls trafficked for<br/>

  the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; Moldovan women are<br/>

  trafficked to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe;<br/>

  girls and young women are trafficked within the country from rural<br/>

  areas to Chisinau; children are also trafficked to neighboring<br/>

  countries for forced labor and begging; labor trafficking of men to<br/>

  work in the construction, agriculture, and service sectors of Russia<br/>

  is increasingly a problem; according to an ILO report, Moldova's<br/>

  national Bureau of Statistics estimated that there were likely over<br/>

  25,000 Moldovan victims of trafficking for forced labor in 2008<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - The Government of Moldova does not<br/>

  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of<br/>

  trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so;<br/>

  despite initial efforts to combat trafficking-related complicity<br/>

  since the government's reassessment on the Tier 2 Watch List in<br/>

  September 2008, and increased victim assistance, the government did<br/>

  not demonstrate sufficiently meaningful efforts to curb<br/>

  trafficking-related corruption, which is a government-acknowledged<br/>

  problem in Moldova; the government improved victim protection<br/>

  efforts, deployed more law-enforcement officers in the effort and<br/>

  contributed direct financial assistance toward victim protection and<br/>

  assistance for the first time (2010)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111468">Niger<br/>

  current situation: Niger is a source, transit, and destination<br/>

  country for children and women trafficked for forced labor and<br/>

  sexual exploitation; caste-based slavery practices, rooted in<br/>

  ancestral master-slave relationships, continue in isolated areas of<br/>

  the country - an estimated 8,800 to 43,000 Nigeriens live under<br/>

  conditions of traditional slavery; children are trafficked within<br/>

  Niger for forced begging, forced labor in gold mines, domestic<br/>

  servitude, sexual exploitation, and possibly for forced labor in<br/>

  agriculture and stone quarries; women and children from neighboring<br/>

  states are trafficked to and through Niger for domestic servitude,<br/>

  sexual exploitation, forced labor in mines and on farms, and as<br/>

  mechanics and welders<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Niger does not<br/>

  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of<br/>

  trafficking and is not making any significant efforts to do so; the<br/>

  government demonstrated marginal efforts to combat human<br/>

  trafficking, including traditional slavery, during the last year<br/>

  (2009)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111469">Papua New Guinea<br/>

  current situation: Papua New Guinea is a country of<br/>

  destination for women and children from Malaysia, the Philippines,<br/>

  Thailand, and China trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual<br/>

  exploitation; internal trafficking of women and children for the<br/>

  purposes of sexual exploitation and involuntary domestic servitude<br/>

  occurs as well<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 3 - Papua New Guinea does not fully comply with<br/>

  the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not<br/>

  making significant efforts to do so; the current legal framework<br/>

  does not contain elements of crimes that characterize trafficking;<br/>

  the government lacks victim protection services or a systematic<br/>

  procedure to identify victims of trafficking; the government did not<br/>

  prosecute anyone in 2007 for trafficking; Papua New Guinea has not<br/>

  ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111470">Qatar<br/>

  current situation: Qatar is a destination country for men and<br/>

  women from South and Southeast Asia who migrate willingly, but are<br/>

  subsequently trafficked into involuntary servitude as domestic<br/>

  workers and laborers, and, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual<br/>

  exploitation; the most common offense was forcing workers to accept<br/>

  worse contract terms than those under which they were recruited;<br/>

  other conditions include bonded labor, withholding of pay,<br/>

  restrictions on movement, arbitrary detention, and physical, mental,<br/>

  and sexual abuse<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Qatar does not<br/>

  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of<br/>

  trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in<br/>

  February 2009, Qatar enacted a new migrant worker sponsorship law<br/>

  that criminalizes some practices commonly used by trafficking<br/>

  offenders, and it announced plans to use that law effectively to<br/>

  prevent human trafficking; punishment for offenses related to<br/>

  trafficking in persons remains lower than that for crimes such as<br/>

  rape and kidnapping, and the Qatari government has yet to take<br/>

  significant action to investigate, prosecute, and punish trafficking<br/>

  offenses; the government continues to lack formal victim<br/>

  identification procedures and, as a result, victims of trafficking<br/>

  are likely punished for acts committed as a direct result of being<br/>

  trafficked (2009)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111471">Russia<br/>

  current situation: Russia is a source, transit, and<br/>

  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for<br/>

  various purposes; it remains a significant source of women<br/>

  trafficked to over 50 countries for commercial sexual exploitation;<br/>

  Russia is also a transit and destination country for men and women<br/>

  trafficked from Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Korea to<br/>

  Central and Western Europe and the Middle East for purposes of<br/>

  forced labor and sexual exploitation; internal trafficking remains a<br/>

  problem in Russia with women trafficked from rural areas to urban<br/>

  centers for commercial sexual exploitation, and men trafficked<br/>

  internally and from Central Asia for forced labor in the<br/>

  construction and agricultural industries; debt bondage is common<br/>

  among trafficking victims, and child sex tourism remains a concern<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Russia is on the Tier 2 Watch List<br/>

  for a fifth consecutive year for its failure to show evidence of<br/>

  increasing efforts to combat trafficking over the previous year,<br/>

  particularly in providing assistance to victims of trafficking;<br/>

  comprehensive trafficking victim assistance legislation, which would<br/>

  address key deficiencies, has been pending before the Duma since<br/>

  2003 and was neither passed nor enacted in 2007 (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111472">Saudi Arabia<br/>

  current situation: Saudi Arabia is a destination<br/>

  country for workers from South and Southeast Asia who are subjected<br/>

  to conditions that constitute involuntary servitude including being<br/>

  subjected to physical and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages,<br/>

  confinement, and withholding of passports as a restriction on their<br/>

  movement; domestic workers are particularly vulnerable because some<br/>

  are confined to the house in which they work unable to seek help;<br/>

  Saudi Arabia is also a destination country for Nigerian, Yemeni,<br/>

  Pakistani, Afghan, Somali, Malian, and Sudanese children trafficked<br/>

  for forced begging and involuntary servitude as street vendors; some<br/>

  Nigerian women were reportedly trafficked into Saudi Arabia for<br/>

  commercial sexual exploitation<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 3 - Saudi Arabia does not fully comply with the<br/>

  minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not<br/>

  making significant efforts to do so; the government continues to<br/>

  lack adequate anti-trafficking laws and, despite evidence of<br/>

  widespread trafficking abuses, did not report any criminal<br/>

  prosecutions, convictions, or prison sentences for trafficking<br/>

  crimes committed against foreign domestic workers (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111473">Sri Lanka<br/>

  current situation: Sri Lanka is a source and destination<br/>

  country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary<br/>

  servitude and commercial sexual exploitation; Sri Lankan men and<br/>

  women migrate willingly to the Persian Gulf, Middle East, and East<br/>

  Asia to work as construction workers, domestic servants, or garment<br/>

  factory workers, where some find themselves in situations of<br/>

  involuntary servitude when faced with restrictions on movement,<br/>

  withholding of passports, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and<br/>

  debt bondage; children are trafficked internally for commercial<br/>

  sexual exploitation and, less frequently, for forced labor<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a fourth consecutive year, Sri<br/>

  Lanka is on the Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence of<br/>

  increasing efforts to combat severe forms of human trafficking,<br/>

  particularly in the area of law enforcement; the government failed<br/>

  to arrest, prosecute, or convict any person for trafficking offenses<br/>

  and continued to punish some victims of trafficking for crimes<br/>

  committed as a result of being trafficked; Sri Lanka has not<br/>

  ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111474">Sudan<br/>

  current situation: Sudan is a source country for men, women,<br/>

  and children trafficked internally for the purposes of forced labor<br/>

  and sexual exploitation; Sudan is also a transit and destination<br/>

  country for Ethiopian women trafficked abroad for domestic<br/>

  servitude; Sudanese women and girls are trafficked within the<br/>

  country as well as possibly to Middle Eastern countries for domestic<br/>

  servitude; the terrorist rebel organization, Lord's Resistance Army,<br/>

  continues to harbor small numbers of Sudanese and Ugandan children<br/>

  in the southern part of the country for use as cooks, porters, and<br/>

  combatants; some of these children are also trafficked across<br/>

  borders into Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo; militia<br/>

  groups in Darfur, some of which are linked to the government, abduct<br/>

  women for short periods of forced labor and to perpetrate sexual<br/>

  violence; during the two decades-long north-south civil war,<br/>

  thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently<br/>

  enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes; while<br/>

  there have been no known new abductions of Dinka by members of<br/>

  Baggara tribes in the last few years, inter-tribal abductions<br/>

  continue in southern Sudan<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 3 - Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum<br/>

  standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making<br/>

  significant efforts to do so; combating human trafficking through<br/>

  law enforcement or prevention measures was not a priority for the<br/>

  government in 2007 (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111475">Swaziland<br/>

  current situation: Swaziland is a source, destination, and<br/>

  transit country for women and children trafficked internally and<br/>

  transnationally for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation,<br/>

  domestic servitude, and forced labor in agriculture; Swazi girls,<br/>

  particularly orphans, are trafficked internally for commercial<br/>

  sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, as well as to South<br/>

  Africa and Mozambique; Swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in<br/>

  commercial agriculture and market vending; some Swazi women are<br/>

  forced into prostitution in South Africa and Mozambique after<br/>

  voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the government of Swaziland does<br/>

  not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of<br/>

  trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the<br/>

  government believes that trafficking probably does occur, but does<br/>

  not know the extent of the problem; the government does not judge<br/>

  trafficking to be an "important" problem and chooses to direct its<br/>

  limited resources towards other issues, a judgment which<br/>

  significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate<br/>

  human trafficking, or to plan anti-trafficking activities or<br/>

  initiatives for the future (2010)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111476">Syria<br/>

  current situation: Syria is a destination and transit country<br/>

  for women and children trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation<br/>

  and forced labor; a significant number of women and children in the<br/>

  large and expanding Iraqi refugee community in Syria are reportedly<br/>

  forced into commercial sexual exploitation by Iraqi gangs or, in<br/>

  some cases, their families; women from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the<br/>

  Philippines, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone are recruited for work in<br/>

  Syria as domestic servants, but some face conditions of involuntary<br/>

  servitude, including long hours, non-payment of wages, withholding<br/>

  of passports, restrictions on movement, threats, and physical or<br/>

  sexual abuse<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Syria again failed to report any<br/>

  law enforcement efforts to punish trafficking offenses in 2007; in<br/>

  addition, the government did not offer protection services to<br/>

  victims of trafficking and may have arrested, prosecuted, or<br/>

  deported some victims for prostitution or immigration violations;<br/>

  Syria has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111477">Tajikistan<br/>

  current situation: Tajikistan is a source country for<br/>

  women trafficked through Kyrgyzstan and Russia to the UAE, Turkey,<br/>

  and Russia for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; men<br/>

  are trafficked to Russia and Kazakhstan for the purpose of forced<br/>

  labor, primarily in the construction and agricultural industries;<br/>

  boys and girls are trafficked internally for various purposes,<br/>

  including forced labor and forced begging<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Tajikistan is on the Tier 2 Watch<br/>

  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to<br/>

  combat human trafficking, especially efforts to investigate,<br/>

  prosecute, convict, and sentence traffickers; despite evidence of<br/>

  low- and mid-level officials' complicity in trafficking, the<br/>

  government did not punish any public officials for trafficking<br/>

  complicity during 2007; lack of capacity and poor coordination<br/>

  between government institutions remained key obstacles to effective<br/>

  anti-trafficking efforts (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111478">Uzbekistan<br/>

  current situation: Uzbekistan is a source country for<br/>

  women and girls trafficked to Kazakhstan, Russia, Middle East, and<br/>

  Asia for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; men are<br/>

  trafficked to Kazakhstan and Russia for purposes of forced labor in<br/>

  the construction, cotton, and tobacco industries; men and women are<br/>

  also trafficked internally for the purposes of domestic servitude,<br/>

  forced labor in the agricultural and construction industries, and<br/>

  for commercial sexual exploitation<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Uzbekistan is on the Tier 2 Watch<br/>

  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to<br/>

  combat severe forms of trafficking in 2007; the government did not<br/>

  amend its criminal code to increase penalties for convicted<br/>

  traffickers; in March 2008, Uzbekistan adopted ILO Conventions on<br/>

  minimum age of employment and on the elimination of the worst forms<br/>

  of child labor and is working with the ILO on implementation; the<br/>

  government also demonstrated its increasing commitment to combat<br/>

  trafficking in March 2008 by adopting a comprehensive<br/>

  anti-trafficking law; Uzbekistan has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP<br/>

  Protocol (2008)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id111479">Venezuela<br/>

  current situation: Venezuela is a source, transit, and<br/>

  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the<br/>

  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor;<br/>

  Venezuelan women and girls are trafficked within the country for<br/>

  sexual exploitation, lured from the nation's interior to urban and<br/>

  tourist areas; child prostitution in urban areas and child sex<br/>

  tourism in resort destinations appear to be growing; Venezuelan<br/>

  women and girls are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation to<br/>

  Western Europe, Mexico, and Caribbean destinations<br/>

  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Venezuela is placed on the Tier 2<br/>

  Watch List, up from Tier 3, as it showed greater resolve to address<br/>

  trafficking through law enforcement measures and prevention efforts<br/>

  in 2007, although stringent punishment of offenders and victim<br/>

  assistance remain lacking (2008)<br/>
