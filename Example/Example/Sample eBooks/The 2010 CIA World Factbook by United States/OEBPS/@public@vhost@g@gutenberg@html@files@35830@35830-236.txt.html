<p id="id113759" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%">  This entry, also know as "M1," comprises the total quantity of
  currency in circulation (notes and coins) plus demand deposits
  denominated in the national currency held by nonbank financial
  institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial public
  enterprises, and the private sector of the economy, measured at a
  specific point in time. National currency units have been converted
  to US dollars at the closing exchange rate for the date of the
  information. Because of exchange rate movements, changes in money
  stocks measured in national currency units may vary significantly
  from those shown in US dollars, and caution is urged when making
  comparisons over time in US dollars. Narrow money consists of more
  liquid assets than broad money and the assets generally function as
  a "medium of exchange" for an economy.
