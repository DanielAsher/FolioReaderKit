<p id="id01006" style="margin-top: 3em">About :: History</p>

<p id="id01007" style="margin-top: 4em">A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook</p>

<p id="id01008" style="margin-top: 2em">The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is
acquired, converted into intelligence, and made available to
policymakers. Information is raw data from any source, data that may
be fragmentary, contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or
wrong. Intelligence is information that has been collected,
integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished
intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to
be delivered to the policymaker.</p>

<p id="id01009" style="margin-top: 2em">The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence
reports on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable
outcomes. The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is
the foundation on which the other two are constructed; current
intelligence continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and
estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations of country
and issue prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence.
The World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National
Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished
intelligence.</p>

<p id="id01010" style="margin-top: 2em">The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities
since the days of George Washington but only since World War II have
they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs
have highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence
since that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies
(JANIS), (2) the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3)The
World Factbook .</p>

<p id="id01011" style="margin-top: 2em">During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought
home to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed
and coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers
as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous
interest. In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines
had to launch amphibious operations against many islands about which
information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities
resolved that the United States should never again be caught
unprepared.</p>

<p id="id01012" style="margin-top: 2em">In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of
Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of
the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort
should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April
1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study
Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the
Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first
interdepartmental basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of
the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of
strategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the
board published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war
effort, and numerous letters of commendation were received,
including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff,
Pacific Ocean Areas, which said, "JANIS has become the indispensable
reference work for the shore-based planners."</p>

<p id="id01013" style="margin-top: 2em">The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar
world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author
on national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than
in war. "The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human
activities - not just the enemy and his war production."</p>

<p id="id01014" style="margin-top: 2em">The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October
1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which
authorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a
peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate
NIS country sections could be produced, government agencies had to
develop more comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board
on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the
Interior produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.</p>

<p id="id01015" style="margin-top: 2em">The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in
1955 that: "The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable
publication which provides the essential elements of basic
intelligence on all areas of the world. There will always be a
continuing requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date." The
Factbook was created as an annual summary and update to the
encyclopedic NIS studies. The first classified Factbook was
published in August 1962, and the first unclassified version was
published in June 1971. The NIS program was terminated in 1973
except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer components. The 1975
Factbook was the first to be made available to the public with sales
through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The Factbook was
first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The year 2010
marks the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of the Central
Intelligence Agency and the 67th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and
its two predecessor programs.</p>

<p id="id01090" style="margin-top: 3em">Frequently Asked Questions(by category)</p>

<p id="id01091" style="margin-top: 3em">Answers to many frequently asked questions (FAQs) are explained in
the Definitions and Notes section inThe World Factbook. Please
review this section to see if your question is already answered
there. In addition, we have compiled the following list of FAQs to
answer other common questions.</p>

<p id="id01092" style="margin-top: 6em">General ::</p>

<p id="id01093" style="margin-top: 3em">Can you provide additional information for a specific country?</p>

<p id="id01094">The staff cannot provide data beyond what appears in The World
Factbook. The format and information in the Factbook are tailored to
the specific requirements of US Government officials and content is
focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes
suggestions for new entries.</p>

<p id="id01095" style="margin-top: 3em">How often is The World Factbook updated?</p>

<p id="id01096">Formerly our Web site and the published Factbook were only updated
annually. In November 2001, we began more frequent online updating
and for many years bi-weekly updates were the norm. In late 2010 we
began to update the online Factbook on a weekly schedule. The CIA
discontinued publishing the printed Factbook after the 2007 edition;
subsequent annual editions have been published by the US Government
Printing Office.</p>

<p id="id01097" style="margin-top: 3em">Can I use some or all of The World Factbook for my Web site (book,
research project, homework, etc.)?</p>

<p id="id01098">The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by
anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code
(Section 403m) prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which
implies that the CIA approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. For
any questions about your intended use, you should consult with legal
counsel. Further information on use of The World Factbook is
described on the Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a
courtesy, please cite The World Factbook when used.</p>

<p id="id01099" style="margin-top: 3em">Why are there discrepancies between The World Factbook's demographic
statistics and other sources?</p>

<p id="id01100">Although estimates and projections start with the same basic data
from censuses, surveys, and registration systems, final estimates
and projections can differ as a result of factors including data
availability, assessment, and methods and protocols.</p>

<p id="id01101">Data availability  Researchers may obtain specific country data at
different times. Estimates or projections developed before the
results of a census have been released will not be as accurate as
those that take into account new census results.</p>

<p id="id01102">Assessment  Researchers can differ in their assessment of data
quality and in their estimates based on the available country data.
They often need to adjust their estimates due to such factors as
undercounting in a census or underregistration of births or deaths.</p>

<p id="id01103">Methods and protocols  Differences in methods and protocols can
shape the way estimates and projections are made of fertility,
mortality, and international migration, and how these data are
integrated with the population data. For example, the US Census
Bureau uses a model that projects the population ahead by single
years of age, a single year at a time (population statistics used in
the Factbook are based on this model), whereas the United Nations
model projects five-year age groups forward, five years at a time.</p>

<p id="id01104" style="margin-top: 4em">Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,
departments, provinces, etc., for each country?</p>

<p id="id01105">The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,
territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative
units within a country. A comprehensive encyclopedia might be a
source for state/province-level information.</p>

<p id="id01106" style="margin-top: 3em">Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do
comparative research and trend analysis?</p>

<p id="id01107">Previous editions of the Factbook , beginning with 2000, are
available for downloading - but not browsing - on the CIA Web site.
Rehosted versions of earlier editions of the Factbook are available
for browsing, as well as for downloading, at other Internet web
sites. We urge caution, however, in attempting to create time series
by stringing together economic data - especially dollar values -
from previous editions of the Factbook . Over time, data sources,
definitions, and economic accounting methods have changed. We
occasionally have made these changes ourselves in order to provide
our readers with the best information available. Also, in the case
of dollar values, changes in relative exchange rates and prices may
make trends difficult to comprehend. Therefore, individuals should
consult additional resources when doing comparative research or
trend analysis.</p>

<p id="id01108" style="margin-top: 3em">Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration
between the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations
or individuals?</p>

<p id="id01109">The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or
individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such
groups or persons choose to provide.</p>

<p id="id01110" style="margin-top: 11em">Geography ::</p>

<p id="id01111" style="margin-top: 3em">Why can't I find a geographic name for a particular country?</p>

<p id="id01112">The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of
places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and
cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions
(in the Government category) and major cities/towns (on the country
maps). Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names
(Appendix F), however, includes many of the world's major geographic
features as well as historic (former) names of countries and cities
mentioned in The World Factbook.</p>

<p id="id01113" style="margin-top: 3em">Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical
order at the end of the Factbook entries?</p>

<p id="id01114" style="margin-top: 2em">Taiwan is listed after the A-Z country entries because even though
the mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected
Taiwanese authorities de facto administer the island and reject
mainland sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic
relations with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government
recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legal
government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there
is only one China and that Taiwan is part of China.</p>

<p id="id01115">The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many
nation-like attributes and these may be expanded in the future. A
more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into the
Factbook can be found in the Preliminary statement.</p>

<p id="id01116" style="margin-top: 4em">Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,
why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?</p>

<p id="id01117">Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term "Holy See" refers to
the authority and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisors to
direct the worldwide Catholic Church. As the jurisdictional equal of
a state, the Holy See can enter into treaties and sends and receives
diplomatic representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to
administer properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is
recognized under international law as a sovereign state, but it does
not send or receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy
See is included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City
cross-referenced in the Geographic Names appendix.</p>

<p id="id01118" style="margin-top: 3em">Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?</p>

<p id="id01119">The Palestinian areas of Gaza Strip and West Bank are listed in the<br/>

Factbook.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01120" style="margin-top: 3em">Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern<br/>

Cyprus with Turkey?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01121">Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United<br/>

States Government are not shown on US Government maps.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01122" style="margin-top: 3em">Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet or<br/>

Kashmir?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01123" style="margin-top: 2em">The World Factbook provides information on the administrative
divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government
that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the
spelling, use, and application of geographic names - domestic,
foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all
departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to
uniform names of geographic features.</p>

<p id="id01124">Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world
whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly
Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute
among countries are not covered.</p>

<p id="id01125" style="margin-top: 4em">What do you mean when you say that a country is "doubly landlocked"?</p>

<p id="id01126">A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean
or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan
and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.</p>

<p id="id01127" style="margin-top: 4em">Why is the area of the United States described as "slightly larger
than China" in the Factbook , while other sources list China as
larger in area than the United States?</p>

<p id="id01128" style="margin-top: 2em">It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and
water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by
the Factbook) or just land area (which excludes inland water
features such as rivers and lakes).</p>

<p id="id01129">Total area (combining land and water)</p>

<p id="id01130">United States = 9,826,630 sq km China = 9,596,960 sq km</p>

<p id="id01131">Land only (without any water features)</p>

<p id="id01132">United States = 9,161,923 sq km China = 9,326,410 sq km</p>

<p id="id01133" style="margin-top: 4em">Why has The World Factbook dropped the four French departments of<br/>

Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and French Guiana?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01134">The four entities are no longer in The World Factbook because their
status has changed. While they are overseas departments of France,
they are also now recognized as French regions, having equal status
to the 22 metropolitan regions that make up European France. In
other words, they are now recognized as being part of France proper.
Their status is somewhat analogous to Alaska and Hawaii vis-a-vis
the contiguous United States. Although separated from the larger
geographic entity, they are still considered to be an integral part
of it.</p>

<p id="id01135" style="margin-top: 11em">Photos ::</p>

<p id="id01136" style="margin-top: 3em">Why do you not have pictures for every country?</p>

<p id="id01137">Inclusion of photos in The World Factbook is a new feature that
premiered with the unveiling of the redesigned online World Factbook
in June 2009. This is a long-term project, and we plan to
continuously add more photos to the site over time. Eventually, we
hope to have images for every country in the Factbook.</p>

<p id="id01138" style="margin-top: 3em">Could you include photos of people from different locations around
the world?</p>

<p id="id01139">Factbook policy is to not include photos showing identifiable
individuals.</p>

<p id="id01140" style="margin-top: 3em">I have great travel photos from my trips abroad. Can I submit them
to your website to enhance your photo collection?</p>

<p id="id01141">We appreciate the many offers from the public to contribute to our
photo collection. However, we only use photos from US Government
sources.</p>

<p id="id01142" style="margin-top: 11em">Spelling and Pronunciation ::</p>

<p id="id01143" style="margin-top: 3em">Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and
prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling
in my country?</p>

<p id="id01144">The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs
of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared
using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not
use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in
its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;
they may appear first in some cultures.</p>

<p id="id01145" style="margin-top: 3em">Why does the spelling of geographic names, features, cities,
administrative divisions, etc. in the Factbook differ from those
used in my country?</p>

<p id="id01146">The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and
approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United
States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures
governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic names -
domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all
departments and agencies of the US Government to use uniform names
of geographic features. (A note is usually included where changes
may have occurred but have not yet been approved by the BGN). The
World Factbook is prepared using the standard American English
computer keyboard and does not use any special characters, symbols,
or most diacritical markings in its spellings.</p>

<p id="id01147" style="margin-top: 3em">Why does The World Factbook omit pronunciations of country or leader
names?</p>

<p id="id01148">There are too many variations in pronunciation among
English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of
non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American
English pronunciations are included for some countries such as Qatar
and Kiribati.</p>

<p id="id01149" style="margin-top: 3em">Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?</p>

<p id="id01150">When American and British spellings of common English words differ,
The World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when
these common words form part of a proper name in British English.</p>

<p id="id01151" style="margin-top: 11em">Policies and Procedures ::</p>

<p id="id01152" style="margin-top: 3em">What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?</p>

<p id="id01153">The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we
judge are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular
category. Space considerations preclude a listing of these various
sources.</p>

<p id="id01154" style="margin-top: 3em">The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook
differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia
the Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other
publications Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan
whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on
naming geographic features?</p>

<p id="id01155">The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board
on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United
States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures
governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic names -
domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all
departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to
uniform names of geographic features. The position of the BGN is
that the names Burma and Sea of Japan be used in official US
Government maps and publications.</p>

<p id="id01156" style="margin-top: 3em">Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in
metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?</p>

<p id="id01157">US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of
1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991
to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as
the metric system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by
over 95 percent of the world's population.</p>

<p id="id01158" style="margin-top: 3em">Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature
extremes?</p>

<p id="id01159">The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful
for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have
large temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a
whole.</p>

<p id="id01160" style="margin-top: 3em">What information sources are used for the country flags?</p>

<p id="id01161">Flag designs used in The World Factbook are based on various
national and vexillological sources.</p>

<p id="id01162" style="margin-top: 3em">Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from
other sources?</p>

<p id="id01163">We have two sets of GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook , one
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and the
other derived from official exchange rates (OER). Other sources
probably use one of the two. See the Definitions and Notes section
on GDP and GDP methodology for more information.</p>

<p id="id01164" style="margin-top: 3em">On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last
update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?</p>

<p id="id01165">Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the
CIA Web site, they are produced and updated on different weekly
schedules. Chiefs of State includes fewer countries but more
leaders, whereas The World Factbook has a much larger database and
includes all countries.</p>

<p id="id01166" style="margin-top: 3em">Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?</p>

<p id="id01167" style="margin-top: 2em">Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add
precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of
precision - i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage
data are totaled, as the following two examples show:</p>

<p id="id01168" style="margin-top: 2em">                  Original Data         Rounded to whole integer</p>

<p id="id01169">Example 1             43.2                       43<br/>

                      30.4                       30<br/>

                      26.4                       26<br/>

                      ——                       —<br/>

                     100.0                       99<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01170">Example 2             42.8                       43<br/>

                      31.6                       32<br/>

                      25.6                       26<br/>

                      ——                       —<br/>

                     100.0                      101<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01171" style="margin-top: 2em">When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,
because doing so would introduce additional error into the
distribution.</p>

<p id="id01172" style="margin-top: 4em">What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?</p>

<p id="id01173">In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff
assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US
Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by
computer - either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The
economic data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the
rounding convention used by virtually all numerical software
applications, namely, any digit followed by a "5" is rounded up to
the next higher digit, no matter whether the original digit is even
or odd. Thus, for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5
becomes 3, rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding
systems.</p>

<p id="id01174" style="margin-top: 3em">Why do you list "Independence" dates for countries such as France,<br/>

Germany, and the United Kingdom?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01175">For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty
was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For
other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood
event such as the traditional founding date or the date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state
succession and so may not strictly be an "Independence" date.
Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted
in this same entry.</p>

<p id="id01176" style="margin-top: 11em">Technical ::</p>

<p id="id01177" style="margin-top: 3em">Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the<br/>

Rehabilitation Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01178">The World Factbook home page has a link entitled "Text/Low Bandwidth
Version." The country data in the text version is fully accessible.
We believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law.
If you are experiencing difficulty, please use our comment form to
provide us details of the specific problem you are experiencing and
the assistive software and/or hardware you are using so that we can
work with our technical support staff to find and implement a

<p id="id01179" style="margin-top: 3em">I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?</p>

<p id="id01180">Hundreds of "Factbook" look-alikes exist on the Internet. You can
access The World Factbook at: www.cia.gov, which is the only
official site.</p>

<p id="id01181" style="margin-top: 3em">When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file

<p id="id01182">Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could

<p id="id01183" style="margin-top: 3em">When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or

<p id="id01188" style="margin-top: 3em">@Afghanistan  (South Asia)</p>

<p id="id01189">Introduction ::Afghanistan</p>

<p id="id01190" style="margin-top: 4em">Background:</p>

<p id="id01191" style="margin-top: 2em">Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded
Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the
British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional
British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a
1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union
invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,
touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989
under relentless pressure by internationally supported
anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars
saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US,
Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled
the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn
Conference in 2001 established a process for political
reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a
presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in
2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically
elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was
inaugurated the following December. Karzai was re-elected in August
2009 for a second term. Despite gains toward building a stable
central government, a resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial
instability - particularly in the south and the east - remain
serious challenges for the Afghan Government.</p>
