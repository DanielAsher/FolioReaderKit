<p class="ad_p_1">By HENRIK IBSEN.</p>
<p class="ad_p_3">TRANSLATED BY</p>
<p>WILLIAM AND CHARLES ARCHER.</p>
<p class="ad_p_2">This Translation, though unrhymed, preserves throughout the various rhythms of the original.</p>
<p class="ad_p_4">“In <cite>Brand</cite> the hero is an embodied protest against the poverty of spirit and half-heartedness that Ibsen rebelled against in his countrymen. In <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> the hero is himself the embodiment of that spirit. In <cite>Brand</cite> the fundamental antithesis, upon which, as its central theme, the drama is constructed, is the contrast between the spirit of compromise on the one hand, and the motto ‘everything or nothing’ on the other. And <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> is the very incarnation of a compromising dread of decisive committal to any one course. In <cite>Brand</cite> the problem of self-realisation and the relation of the individual to his surroundings is obscurely struggling for recognition, and in <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> it becomes the formal theme upon which all the fantastic variations of the drama are built up. In both plays alike the problems of heredity and the influence of early surroundings are more than touched upon; and both alike culminate in the doctrine that the only redeeming power on earth or in heaven is the power of love.”—Mr. <span class="name">P. H. Wicksteed</span>.</p>

</li>
<li>LIFE OF SCHOPENHAUER. By <span class="name">Professor Wallace</span>.

</li>
<li><a id="pagew" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="w"></a>LIFE OF SHERIDAN. By <span class="name">Lloyd Sanders</span>.

<p class="ad_p_1">Edited by WILLIAM ARCHER.</p>
<p>Complete in Five Vols. Crown 8vo, Cloth, Price 3/6 each.<br/>
Set of Five Vols., in Case, 17/6; in Half Morocco, in Case, 32/6.</p>
<p class="ad_p_7">“We seem at last to be shown men and women as they are; and at first it is more than we can endure…. All Ibsen’s characters speak and act as if they were hypnotised, and under their creators imperious demand to reveal themselves. There never was such a mirror held up to nature before: it is too terrible…. Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his remorseless surgery, his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have grown strong and learned to face the naked—if necessary, the flayed and bleeding—reality.”—<cite>Speaker</cite> <em>(London)</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vol. I. “A DOLL’S HOUSE,” “THE LEAGUE OF YOUTH,” and “THE PILLARS OF SOCIETY.” With Portrait of the Author, and Biographical Introduction by <span class="name">William Archer</span>.</li>
<li>Vol. II. “GHOSTS,” “AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,” and “THE WILD DUCK.” With an Introductory Note.</li>
<li>Vol. III. “LADY INGER OF ÖSTRÅT,” “THE VIKINGS AT HELGELAND,” “THE PRETENDERS.” With an Introductory Note and Portrait of Ibsen.</li>
<li>Vol. IV. “EMPEROR AND GALILEAN.” With an Introductory Note by <span class="name">William Archer</span>.</li>
<li>Vol. V. “ROSMERSHOLM,” “THE LADY FROM THE SEA,” “HEDDA GABLER.” Translated by <span class="name">William Archer</span>. With an Introductory Note.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ad_p_4">The sequence of the plays <em>in each volume</em> is chronological; the complete set of volumes comprising the dramas thus presents them in chronological order.</p>
<p class="ad_p_4">“The art of prose translation does not perhaps enjoy a very high literary status in England, but we have no hesitation in numbering the present version of Ibsen, so far as it has gone (Vols. I. and II.), among the very best achievements, in that kind, of our generation.”—<cite>Academy</cite>.</p>
<p class="ad_p_4">“We have seldom, if ever, met with a translation so absolutely idiomatic.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>.</p>
