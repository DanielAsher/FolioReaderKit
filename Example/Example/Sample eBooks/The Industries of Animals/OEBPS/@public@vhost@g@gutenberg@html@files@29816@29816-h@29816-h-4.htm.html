PROVISIONS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS.</h2>

<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> industries of the chase which are derived immediately from the most imperious of needs — that of assuring the existence of the individual — never arrive at a very extraordinary degree of perfection; or at all events, as they are indispensable to existence, we are not surprised at their development. It is unquestionable that an industry marks a higher degree of civilisation not only by its development, but still more by its reference to the less necessary things of life; in every species the importance of the place given to the superfluous is a mark of superiority. The animals who, foreseeing a hard season, or fearing <a id="page81" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="81"></a>the days when hunting will not be productive, lay up provisions to utilise in such times of famine, rise a degree higher than even the most skilful hunters. Not all amass with the same sagacity, and we shall find different examples of foresight, from the most rudimentary to the highest, very near what we may observe in Man.</p>
<p>The provisions harvested by animals have more than one destination: some are for the individual himself who has gathered them; others, on the contrary, are to serve as the food for his young at the age when they are not yet capable of seeking their own food. I will deal with these latter in another chapter, and propose at present only to speak of those animals who provision barns with the intention of themselves profiting by them.</p>
<p>The foresight of the animal is so much the greater the more remote the future for which he prepares. The Carnivora live from day to day and lay up no stores; it is the Rodents, certain frugivorous birds, and insects who exhibit the most complicated acts of economy.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_1">Provisions laid up for a short period.</em> — As a rudimentary example of the art of preserving food in view of possible famine, I may mention the case of the <em xml:lang="la">Lanius collurio</em>. I have already spoken of this bird and of his custom in days of abundance of spitting on thorns all the captures he has made. One may see side by side Coleoptera, crickets, grasshoppers, frogs, and small birds. It is evident that these reserves cannot be preserved for more than a day, or at most two days. The bird amasses just enough to show us his apprehensions of the possible future lack of success in hunting, and his thought of <a id="page82" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="82"></a>preserving the surplus of the present in view of privations to come.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_47" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm47" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">47</a></p>
<p>The Fox, a very skilful hunter, has no trouble in finding game; of all the Carnivora he is, however, the only one who is truly foreseeing. The others in presence of abundant food gorge themselves, and abandon the rest at the risk of suffering to-morrow. The fox is not so careless. If he has had the good fortune to discover a poultry yard, well supplied but ill watched, he carries away as many fowls as he can before dawn and hides them in the neighbourhood of his burrow. He places each by itself, one at the foot of a hedge, another beneath a bush, a third in a hole rapidly hollowed out and closed up again. It is said that he thus scatters his treasures to avoid the risk of losing all at one stroke, although this prudence complicates his task when he needs to utilise his provisions. The fox, however, loses nothing, and knows very well where to find his stores. The very nature of the game prevents him from keeping it more than a few days.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_2">Provisions laid up for a long period.</em> — The Rodents, who live on dry fruits or grains, can on the other hand preserve them for a long time in their barns. The Squirrel, who may be seen all the summer leaping like a little madman from branch to branch, and who seems to have no cares except to exhibit his red fleece and show off his tail, is, contrary to appearance, a most sensible and methodical animal. He knows that winter is a hard time for poor beasts, and that fruits are then rare or hidden beneath the snow; in the autumn, therefore, when all the riches of the earth are abundant, and beech-nuts, acorns, and chestnuts <a id="page83" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="83"></a>have ripened, he harvests quantities of them and hides them wherever he can. Making use of the cavities he is acquainted with around his domain, hollow trees, holes that he makes in the earth beneath bushes, etc., he fills them with fruits, and when winter has come he extracts them to munch.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_3">Animals who construct barns.</em> — The Field Rat of Hungary and Asia (<em xml:lang="la">Psammomys</em>) gathers wheat during the summer. He cuts the blades and transports them to his home, where he stores them up in very considerable quantities; and during rigorous winters when famine appears also among men, gleaners of another species appear on the scene and seek for corn under the earth in the nests of the <em xml:lang="la">Psammomys</em>. A single rat can store up more than a bushel. Those who are skilful in finding their holes can thus in a day glean a good harvest, to the detriment of the rats who are thus in their turn reduced to beggary.</p>
<p>The Hamster also makes provision of grain, but he introduces two improvements: the first at the harvest by only taking the edible part of the ear, and the second by constructing barns distinct from his home. Each possesses a burrow composed of a sleeping chamber, around which he has hollowed one or two others communicating with the first by passages, and intended to serve as barns. The old and more experienced animals prepare even four or five of these storehouses. The end of summer is their season for work. They scatter themselves in the fields of barley or wheat, pull down the stalks of the cereals with their anterior paws, and then cut off the ear with their teeth. This done, they set about thrashing their wheat — that is to say, they separate the grain from the <a id="page84" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="84"></a>straw by turning the ear round and round between their paws. When the grains come out they pile them up in their cheeks, and thus transport them to one of the chambers already mentioned; they then return to exploit the field and continue these labours until they have completed the stores for winter.</p>
<p>A certain Vole (<em xml:lang="la">Arvicola economus</em>) acts in much the same way as the Hamster, though he harvests a different class of objects. It is not wheat which he collects but roots. He has to find these roots, to dig them up, to cut them into fragments of suitable dimensions for transport, and finally to pile them up in rooms disposed to receive them. This species, which inhabits Siberia, measures about twelve centimetres in length, but during summer and autumn Voles accomplish an amount of work which is surprising having regard to their size. The moment having arrived to think about winter, the Voles spread themselves about the steppe. Each hollows little pits around the roots he wishes to extract. After having bared them he cleans them while still in position, so as not to encumber his storehouses with useless earth. This preparatory labour having been completed, he divides the root into slices of a weight proportioned to his strength, and carries away the fragments one by one. Seizing each with his teeth, he walks backwards drawing it after him, and thus traverses a long road, crossing paths, going round tufts of grass or other obstacles, not letting himself be rebuffed by the difficulty and length of the task. Arrived at his hole, he enters this also backwards, drawing his burden through all his galleries. His dwelling, though the entrance is rather more complicated, resembles that of the Hamster. Like the latter, it is composed of a <a id="page85" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="85"></a>central room placed in communication with the outside by a maze of passages, which cross one another. That is the sleeping-room, the walls of which are well formed, and which is carpeted with hay. From this various underground passages start which lead to the storerooms, which are three or four in number. It is to these that the Vole bears his harvest. Each compartment is large enough to contain four or five kilogrammes of roots, so that the little rodent finds himself at the end of the season the proprietor of about fifteen kilogrammes of food in reserve. He would have enough to enable him to revel in abundance if he were able to reckon without his neighbours. This diligent animal has in fact one terrible parasite. This is Man, who will not allow him to enjoy in peace the fruits of his long labour and economy. In Siberia, a long and severe winter follows a very hot summer; in this season the inhabitants often lack provisions. A moment comes when they are glad to make up for want of bread by edible roots; but the search for these is long and troublesome, and should indeed have been thought of during summer. Man, during the fine weather less foreseeing than the rodent, does not hesitate when famine has come to turn to him for help. As he is the weaker, the Vole is obliged to submit to this vexatious tax. According to Pallas,<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_48" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm48" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">48</a> the inhabitants seek these nests full of provisions and dig them up. The conqueror takes all he pleases, and abandons the rest to the unfortunate little beast, who, whether he likes it or not, has to be content. In this region the <a id="page86" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="86"></a>burrows of the Vole abound; therefore this singular tithe ensures a considerable revenue to those who levy it, as may be understood when we remember the extent of the stores amassed by the animal.</p>
<p>A Vole resembling the <em xml:lang="la">Arvicola arvalis</em>, but larger, paler, and more rat-like, with large shining eyes and very short tail, overran in 1892-93 the classic land of Thessaly, the land of Olympus, and the Vale of Tempe. It has always inhabited this region, and the old Greeks had an Apollo Smintheus, or Myoktonos, the Mouse-destroying God. “At the beginning of March,” according to Prof. Loeffler, who has given an account of this invasion,<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_49" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm49" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">49</a> “the Voles were only beginning to troop from the slopes of the hills and the fallow-lands to the cultivated fields. It was frequently observed that they followed regular paths during their inroads. Thus they advanced along the railway embankment. Their progress seemed to be rather slow. Perhaps they do not advance further till the inhabitants of one of their strongholds or so-called castles have become too numerous. The runs which they excavate are at a depth of about twenty to thirty centimetres below the surface of the ground. The extent of their runs varies, and we found them extending in length from thirty to forty metres and more. These runs are connected with the surface by vertical holes of about five centimetres in diameter. In many places four, five, and more holes have led to the same run. In such cases there is generally, not far off, an enlargement for the nest, lined with finely-ground vegetable material, where the young are produced <a id="page87" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="87"></a>and reared. In front of newly-opened holes the earth, which has been thrown far out, forms smooth hillocks. There were many well-defined and well-trodden paths on the ground, by which the Voles pass from one hole to another. They are never seen out of their holes by day, not even in places where the entire ground is riddled with holes like a sieve. They do not come out in search of food till the evening; even then not many are to be seen, but the peculiar squeaking noise they make is to be heard everywhere. Next day all sorts of freshly-severed plants are to be found in the holes. Stalks of corn they manipulate by standing on their hind legs and gnawing through the stalk; when this is bitten off they drag it into their holes to devour it there, sometimes making it smaller. They do their work with amazing rapidity. One evening a field was visited which was to be mowed next day, but when the labourers came in the morning they found nothing to cut. The Voles had destroyed the entire crop in a single night. A miller in the neighbourhood of Velestino reported that he went to his field early one morning, cut a measure of corn, loaded it on his ass, and brought it to his mill. When he returned to his mill with a second load he found scarcely a vestige of the first remaining. Thinking it had been stolen he kept watch for the thief; but suddenly, to his great astonishment, hosts of Voles appeared and set to work to carry off the second load.” Such facts as these recorded by Loeffler are by no means a merely recent phenomenon; Aristotle was familiar with the devastations of the Voles, and wrote that “some small farmers, having one day observed that their corn was ready for harvest, when they went the following day to cut <a id="page88" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="88"></a>their corn, found it all eaten.” Other ancient writers record similar facts.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_50" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm50" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">50</a></p>
<p>Two birds of North America, belonging to the Woodpecker family, prepare their provisions for the bad season with consummate art; not only do they harvest them and place them in shelter, but they arrange them in such a manner that at the right moment they can utilise them in the most convenient manner.</p>
<p>One of them which is common in California, the <em xml:lang="la">Melanerpes formicivorus</em>, nourishes himself, as his name indicates, by insects, and especially ants. All the summer he gives himself up to this hunt, but at the same time he collects acorns, which he does not touch, however, so long as he can find other food. He amasses them in the following ingenious manner: he chooses a tree and hollows out in its trunk a cavity just capable of receiving one acorn. He then carries a fruit and introduces it forcibly into the hole he has just made. Thus buried, the acorn can neither fall nor become the prey of another animal. In the domain of these birds trees may be found which are riddled like a sieve with holes stopped up by an acorn as by a plug. When the hunting of insects ceases to be fruitful, the <em xml:lang="la">Melanerpes</em> visits his barns. If an ordinary bird wished to eat one of these fruits, at each stroke of his beak, on account of the polish and convexity of the acorn’s surface, it would escape <a id="page89" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="89"></a>him, and only by a series of reiterated efforts would the interior be exposed; but for the American woodpecker the task is simplified; each acorn being maintained firmly in the bark, it is sufficient to break the envelope and the pulp is easily seized.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_51" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm51" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">51</a></p>
<p>A relation of this bird, the <em xml:lang="la">Colaptes mexicanus</em>, does not yield to him in economy and skill. He places his barn in the interior of a plant which is very abundant in the zone he inhabits. Insectivorous during a part of the year, he is forced to renounce this diet during the dry season. In the regions of Mexico where this bird is found the dry period is so absolute that he would die of hunger for want of insects or fruits if he had not taken the precaution of laying up stores during spring. His store consists of acorns. He has not time to fix them one by one, like the <em xml:lang="la">Melanerpes</em>, and only thinks at first of rapidly collecting a large quantity. But it is in deciding the question as to where they are to be laid up that the <em xml:lang="la">Colaptes</em> shows his remarkable intelligence. In the forests where he lives are to be found aloes, yuccas, and agaves. When the agaves have flowered, the flower-bearing stem, two or three metres in length, shrivels, but remains standing for some time. Its peripheral portion is hardened by the heat, while the sap in the interior almost entirely disappears. A hollow cylinder with a well-sheltered cavity is thus formed, and the <em xml:lang="la">Colaptes</em> proposes to utilise it as a storehouse. His acorns will there be well protected against external influences and against the birds whose beaks are too weak to pierce the agave. It is then a question of filling <a id="page90" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="90"></a>the tube. The animal first pierces the wall towards the base of the stalk; through this hole he introduces acorns until he has filled the lower part of the cavity. This done, he makes a new hole rather above the first, and fills the interval between the two, continuing this process until he has arrived at the top of the stalk and filled the whole interior. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-4.htm.html#fig10_11" id="fig10_11mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Figs. 10 and 11.</a>) The bird seems at first to take unnecessary trouble by boring so many holes. He would reach his end as well, it would seem, by making a single hole at the top to fill his storehouse, and another at the bottom to empty it. But we must not thus accuse him of lack of judgment. The interior of the tube is just large enough for the passage of an acorn; but at certain points the sap is not entirely absorbed, and there might easily be an impediment which would leave a large part of the cavity empty. Hence the necessity for a number of openings. When the sun has scorched up plants, and provisions are rare, he turns to his barns of abundance. Now and every time that he has need he can utilise the method that has been employed by his cousin the <em xml:lang="la">Melanerpes</em>. In order to feed on each acorn without too much trouble, or allowing it to slip from his beak, the bird places it in a vice. He hollows a hole in the trunk of a tree, introduces the fruit there forcibly, and eats it at his ease.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_52" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm52" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">52</a></p>

<p>The provisions collected by these two birds reveal a remarkable fact. They possess indeed two distinct diets; they do not preserve for the period of famine the overplus of the foods which they consume in the period of abundance. They chase insects and feed on <a id="page92" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="92"></a>them as long as they can find them, while they gather up in their storehouses an entirely different food.</p>
<p><em xml:lang="la">Physiological reserves.</em> — All the animals of which I have just spoken place their provisions for the future in barns in the same manner as Man. Those who have not this foresight are either able to nourish themselves in all seasons by the chase, or else, after having feasted one half of the year, they fast during the other half. In the latter case they consume during the fasting period a portion of their own substance, and use up materials placed in reserve in their organism, in the form of fat for example. This arrangement, which allows them to prolong life, though growing thin, until the next season of prosperity, is not under the control of the will. It is a complication of physiological phenomena resulting from the functioning of different parts of the organism.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_4">Stages between physiological reserves and provisions.</em> — Between physiological reserves and industrial stores we may place as an intermediate stage the interesting case of the Honey Ants.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_53" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm53" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">53</a></p>

</div>
<p>These insects (<em xml:lang="la">Myrmecocystus</em>) live in Texas, and form colonies in which certain individuals play a very special part They exaggerate to an extreme point the power of preserving provisions in their crops. These materials are not assimilated; they do not form part of the animal’s body, and although placed inside it cannot be compared to physiological reserves. It is especially curious that they are not to be utilised only by the animal itself, but also by the other members of the colony who are not able to form <a id="page93" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="93"></a>such stores. Among the <em xml:lang="la">Myrmecocystus</em> there are workers of two sorts; the first kind resemble other ants with some differences of detail, and build and hollow the earth nest which shelters the community. The second kind is quite different; the abdomen in these workers is enormously distended so as to constitute a voluminous sphere, which may become four or five times larger than the thorax and head together. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-4.htm.html#fig12" id="fig12mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 12.</a>) On this distended receptacle appear several darker plates; these are the remains of the chitinous parts of the primitive wings. In the fine season these ants go out in a band and collect a sweet liquor which forms pearly drops on certain galls of oak leaves. These drops, elaborated into honey, gradually fill the crop, distending it and pushing back neighbouring organs until it receives its globular form. When they have arrived at this obese condition, the heavy honey ants no longer leave the nest. They remain without movement, hanging by their legs to the roof or lying against the walls of a room. The workers who have remained slender come and go, attending to their usual occupations, and pass near the others without paying attention to them or going out of the way to lend assistance to their impotent sisters when one of them has rolled over on the ground and can no longer arise unaided. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-4.htm.html#fig13" id="fig13mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 13.</a>) They only cease to be indifferent when impelled by the selfish sentiment of hunger, and then it is to ask and not to give assistance. The fat ants in <a id="page94" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="94"></a>fact could not themselves consume all the honey that they have elaborated; the others in times of famine approach them, caress them with their antennæ, and obtain by solicitation a drop of honey which the large ones disgorge from the crop. Here, then, is a colony in which the division of labour has reached a remarkable degree of polymorphism. Some of the members accomplish the work of engineers and masons, while the others fabricate for the community a store of honey. Instead of depositing these provisions in cells like bees, they preserve them in their own digestive tube. This custom has re-acted to such an <a id="page95" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="95"></a>extent on the form of their bodies that at first sight they seem to belong to a different species.</p>

<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_5">Animals who submit foods to special preparation in order to facilitate transport.</em> — Not content with collecting materials as they are found in nature, certain animals submit them to preparation with various aims, either to render transport easier or that they may not deteriorate when stored. Among those of whom I have just spoken, some collect with the view of utilising their stores in a more remote future than others. The <em xml:lang="la">Ateucus sacer</em> intends to consume the provisions he prepares almost immediately. Yet he acts in so careful a manner that I cannot pass him in silence. This beetle is the sacred Scarabæus so venerated by the Egyptians, who have everywhere reproduced his image in porphyry and granite. He is a most singular insect. The celebrated Fabre has given a complete and very picturesque history of his customs.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_54" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm54" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">54</a> I have myself had an opportunity of seeing him at work. It was in Persia, in the plain of Susiana, on a hot morning in March. We had passed the night in the open air, proposing to continue our journey in the early morning, but our mules, rendered rather lively by the fresh grass brought out by the spring weather, had decided otherwise. They had all decamped to take a ramble on their own account. In order to pass away the hours taken up by the muleteers in searching for the strayed animals, the Scarabæus would, I thought, furnish me with an amusing and instructive spectacle. During the night the mules had not failed to leave here and there the relics of their digestion. The aroma, borne on the morning breeze, had struck the Scarabæus on awaking. <a id="page96" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="96"></a>It was his favourite dish. From all points of the sky their heavy silhouettes could be seen against the blue. It was still fresh, the sun having only risen about an hour before; the heat would soon become oppressive, and the sybaritic beetle, without attending to his morning appetite, which his fresh meal could not fail to excite, nourishes the bourgeois dream of making his little pile in order to enjoy himself sheltered from the hot rays. Immediately on arriving on the scene of the accident each began to display feverish activity. All set to work. With their heads, the anterior edge of which is flat and supplied with six strong spines, they raised their provisions; with their anterior feet, which are large and also armed with spines, they moulded the paste and placed it beneath the abdomen between the four other legs, giving it a rounded form. Little by little the sphere increased and acquired the size of a small apple. That was sufficiently large, and besides it was already becoming hot. The insect set about carting away his prize to a sheltered dining-room. <a id="page97" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="97"></a>He placed his four posterior legs on the ball; with the two last, which were continually moving, he made certain of the equilibrium of the mass; then resting his head and two anterior feet on the ground he pushed backwards, and with extreme rapidity. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-4.htm.html#fig14" id="fig14mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 14.</a>) There was enough for all; each worker could find the just reward for his labour; I witnessed none of the regrettable facts narrated by Fabre. It happens sometimes, according to this ingenious observer, that a cunning Scarabæus, who has taken no part in the laborious labour of moulding the paste, arrives when it is on the road to aid the convoy, or even simply to pretend to help, in order that when the moment has come he may claim a share in the coveted meal, or even carry it all away if he can profit by a momentary inattention on the part of the lawful proprietor. I followed one of these Coleoptera for more than five metres from the place where his labour began. After having deposited his ball he began to dig up the earth around it;<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_55" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm55" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">55</a> but the mules had returned and I was obliged to depart.</p>

</div>
<p>I have no doubt that subsequent events were not exactly the same as narrated by Fabre for the Scarabæus of Provence. The insect having made his hole, buries himself in it for a <em xml:lang="fr">tête à tête</em> with the precious sphere. He immediately sets about passing the whole through his body. Without haste but without rest, for a week or a fortnight, as long as there is any of it left, he eats continuously, and continuously digests. He does not stop for a moment, his jaws are working the whole time; and Fabre has called attention to the fact that <a id="page98" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="98"></a>from the opposite extremity of the animal a continuous thread emerges without breaking, and becomes coiled up.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_6">Care bestowed on harvested provisions.</em> — Among the animals who take particular care of the provisions they have amassed, special mention must be made of certain species of Ants. It was formerly believed that these industrious Hymenoptera are not accustomed to store up in barns for the winter. This opinion long prevailed owing to the authority of Huber, so competent in these matters, although the ancients were well acquainted with the storehouses of ants.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_56" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm56" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">56</a> But it was founded on an exclusive study of these insects in northern countries, in which, during the cold season, they become torpid and buried in their hybernal sleep. Naturally they have no need of food during this period, but it was incorrect to generalise from this fact. The ants of the south are active all the year round. An English naturalist, Moggridge, who passed several winters at Mentone, has placed this fact out of doubt. Suffering from an incurable disease, he occupied the last years of his life in observing and setting down for the instruction of others the habits of these insects. He found that ants of the species <em xml:lang="la">Atta barbara</em> store up grains. They utilise plants of various kinds, but usually fumitory, oats, nettle, various species of <em xml:lang="la">Veronica</em>, etc. They procure these grains towards the end of autumn, collecting them on the soil, or even, when they do not fall in sufficient quantities, climbing up the plants and gathering them in position. An ant will, for instance, ascend the stem of a fruiting plant, of shepherd’s-purse, let us say, and select a <a id="page99" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="99"></a>well-filled but green pod, mid-way up the stem, those below being ready to shed their seeds at a touch. Then seizing it in its jaws, and fixing its hind legs firmly as a pivot, it contrives to turn round and round, and so to strain the fibres of the fruit-stalk until they snap; it then patiently backs down the stem. Sometimes two ants combine their efforts; one, at the base of the peduncle, gnaws at the point of greatest tension, while the other hauls upon it and twists it. And sometimes the ants drop the capsules to their companions below, corresponding with the curious account given by Ælian of the way the spikelets of corn are thrown down “to the people below.” In this labour they display the activity usual in their race, and do not stop until they have carried away to their barns the amount of provision they desire. When their wealth is stored up in the nest, the ants pile up the grains in some hundred little rooms designed for this purpose, each measuring from seven to eight centimetres in diameter, and three or four in height; the average granary being about the size of a gentleman’s gold watch. Adding up the quantities of grain divided between these different barns, it is found that they may be estimated at about 500 or 600 grammes, which represents a very large number of meals for such small appetites, and must cost colossal labour if we take into consideration the size of the workers. But when the harvest is completed, the <em xml:lang="la">Atta barbara</em> have not completed their task; they are too ingenious to limit themselves to waiting with crossed legs for the moment to come when they may enjoy their labour, without considering the damage that may arise. Their first care is to prevent the grains from germinating for some weeks. How they obtain <a id="page100" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="100"></a>this result is not exactly known, but it is certain that germination does not take place, although all the conditions of heat and moisture offered by the interior of the ant-hill are favourable to it; it is not less certain that this arrest is due to the ants. This is shown in a very simple manner. It is sufficient to prevent the access of the insects to one of these chambers to cause the grains to germinate immediately. We can only suppose some direct action of the ants, every other hypothesis falling before this single fact: the arrested phenomenon is produced as soon as the <em xml:lang="la">Atta barbara</em> no longer acts on it. Therefore they arrest germination without rendering it impossible, and when the moment arrives for utilising the accumulated stores, their first care is to allow the grains to follow the normal course of evolution. The envelope breaks, the little plant makes its appearance; radicle and stalk come to light. But the ants do not permit the development to go too far. The little plant, in order to grow, digests the starch which is associated with the albumen, for it is not yet able to draw its nourishment direct from the soil. To be absorbed and assimilated this starch must first be transformed into sugar. This chemical transformation being effected, the grain is in the condition in which the ants prefer it. Like a wine-grower who watches over the fermentation in his vat, and stops it before the wine turns sour, they stop the digestion of the starch at this stage. If we do not know how they retard germination, we know at all events how they render it impossible at this later stage. It is the young plant which absorbs the glucose, and which must therefore be destroyed; they cut off the radicle with their mandibles, and gnaw the stalk; the germ <a id="page101" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="101"></a>is thus suppressed. They have not yet finished their manipulations, which must enable them to preserve without further alteration the provisions which they have already rendered palatable. They bring out all their provisions to the sun, dry them, and take them back to the barns. As long as winter lasts they feed on this sweet flour. An anatomical peculiarity enables them to make the most of it; their mouth is so arranged that they can absorb solid particles and eat the albuminous powder. In this they differ from their northern kin, who are obliged to feed exclusively on juices.</p>
<p>I have compared the labours of these ants to those of the wine-grower. Both of them in fact utilise the chemical phenomena going on in living matter; both of them know how at a given moment to prevent the transformation from going further. Neither of them for the rest take into account the part played by diastasis and ferments. The ancestors of one as of the other have by chance found out the method, and they transmit it from generation to generation.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_57" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm57" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">57</a></p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_7">Agricultural Ants.</em> — The art of amassing stores is still more highly perfected by an Ant which inhabits North America. It is called the <em xml:lang="la">Pogonomyrmex barbatus</em>, or, on account of its customs, the Agricultural Ant. It carries out a certain number of preparatory acts, and pushes foresight further than any other animal, since it looks after its property while still growing. It is grain which these insects collect, but only a single species of graminaceous grain. This choice leads them to spend great trouble <a id="page102" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="102"></a>on their preferred plant. They act in such a way that in the case of men we should say, purely and simply, that they were cultivating. The art of treating the earth with a view of augmenting the products which it yields is certainly of all the manifestations of human activity that which we should least expect to find among animals. It is, however, impossible otherwise to describe the conduct of Agricultural Ants. The field which they prepare is found in front of their ant-hill; it is a terrace in extent about a square metre or more; there they will allow no other plant to grow but that from which they propose to gather fruit. This latter (<em xml:lang="la">Aristida stricta</em>) is rather like a grain of oats, and in taste resembles rice; in America it is called ant rice. This culture represents for these insects a much more important property than a wheat field for man. It is, in relation to their size, a forest planted with great trees, in comparison with which baobabs and sequoias are dwarfs. It is not known if the <em xml:lang="la">Pogonomyrmex</em> sow their rice; Lincecum asserted that the ants actually sow the seeds, that he had seen the process going on year after year; “there can be no doubt,” he concludes, “of the fact that this particular species of grass is intentionally planted, and in farmer-like manner carefully divested of all other grasses and weeds during the time of its growth.”<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_58" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm58" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">58</a> McCook is not able to accept this unqualified conclusion. “I do not believe that the ants deliberately sow a crop, as Lincecum asserts, but that they have, for some reason, <a id="page103" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="103"></a>found it to their advantage to permit the <em xml:lang="la">Aristida</em> to grow upon their disks, while they clear off all other herbage; that the crop is seeded yearly in a natural way by droppings from the plant, or by seeds cast out by the ants, or dropped by them; that the probable reason for protecting the <em xml:lang="la">Aristida</em> is the greater convenience of harvesting the seed; but, finally, that there is nothing unreasonable, nor beyond the probable capacity of the emmet intellect, in the supposition that the crop is actually sown. Simply, it is the Scotch verdict — Not proven.”<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_59" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm59" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">59</a> However it may be, they certainly allow no other plant to grow in the neighbourhood of their grain, to withdraw the nourishment which they wish to reserve entirely for it. Properly speaking, they weed their field, cutting off with their jaws all the troublesome plants which appear above the soil. They pursue this labour very diligently, and no strange shoot escapes their investigations. Thus cared for, their culture flourishes, and at the epoch of maturity the grains are collected one by one and carried within. Like all harvesters, these Hymenoptera are at the mercy of a shower that may fall during the harvest. They are well aware that in this case their provisions would be damaged, and that they would run the risk of germination or decay in the barns. Therefore, on the first sunny day all the ants, as observed by Lincecum and Buckley, may be seen carrying their grains outside, only bringing them back when they have been thoroughly dried, and always leaving behind those that have sprouted.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_60" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm60" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">60</a></p>
<p><a id="page104" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="104"></a><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_8">Gardening Ants.</em> — The Leaf-cutting Ants (<em xml:lang="la">Œcodoma</em>) of tropical America are often alluded to by travellers on account of their ravages on vegetation; and they are capable of destroying whole plantations of orange, mango, and lemon trees. They climb the tree, station themselves on the edge of a leaf and make a circular incision with their scissor-like jaws; the piece of leaf, about the size of a sixpence, held vertically between the jaws, is then borne off to the formicarium. This consists of low wide mounds, in the neighbourhood of which no vegetation is allowed, probably in order that the ventilation of the underground galleries may not be interfered with.</p>
<p>For a long time there was considerable doubt as to the use to which the leaf-cutting ants put the leaves; some naturalists supposed they are used directly as food, others that the ants roof their underground dwellings with them. The question was set at rest by Fritz Müller, who observed these ants in Brazil,<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_61" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm61" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">61</a> and independently by Belt, who studied them in Nicaragua, and has written an interesting account of their proceedings.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_62" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm62" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">62</a> The real use of the leaves is as manure on which to grow a minute species of fungus; these ants are, in reality, mushroom growers and eaters. Belt several times exposed the underground chambers to observation and found that they were always about three parts filled with “a speckled, brown, flocculent, spongy-looking mass of a light and loosely-connected substance.” Scattered throughout these masses were the pupæ and larvæ, together with the smallest division of workers who do not engage in leaf-carrying, but whose duties appear to be to cut up the <a id="page105" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="105"></a>leaves into small fragments and to care for the young. On examination the masses proved to be composed of “minutely sub-divided pieces of leaves, withered to a brown colour, and overgrown and lightly connected together by a minute white fungus that ramified in every direction throughout it.” That they do not eat the leaves themselves was shown by the fact that near the tenanted chambers were found deserted ones filled with the refuse of leaves that had been exhausted as manure, and which served as food for the larvæ of various beetles. There are numerous holes leading up from the underground chambers, and these are opened out or closed up, apparently in order to regulate the temperature below. Great care is also taken that the nest should be neither too dry nor too damp; if a sudden shower comes on the leaves are left near the entrance, and carried down when nearly dry; during very hot weather, on the other hand, when the leaves would be parched in a very short time, the ants only work in the cool of the day and during the night. Occasionally, inexperienced ants carry in grass and unsuitable leaves; these are invariably brought out again and thrown away.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_63" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm63" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">63</a></p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_9">Domestic animals of Ants.</em> — Following through different species the perfection reached in the art of laying up provisions for the future, we have gradually arrived at methods resembling those of Man. But a foresight still greater and nearer to his is manifested by those ants who breed and keep near them animals of different species, not for the sake of their flesh, but for certain secretions, just as man utilises the milk <a id="page106" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="106"></a>of the cow or the goat. Ants have true domestic animals belonging to a variety of species, but the most widely spread are the <em xml:lang="la">Claviger</em> and the Aphides or plant-lice. To keep these insects at their disposal, Hymenoptera act in various ways: some, who are a little experienced, are content to take advantage of a free aphis which chance may put in their way; others shut up their cattle in stables situated in the midst of the ant-hill, or else pen them in the country at a spot where they can best find their food. These facts have long since been carefully studied and leave no room for doubt.</p>
<p>The <em xml:lang="la">Claviger testaceus</em> is a small beetle, often met in the dwellings of ants. Nature has not been very generous on its behalf. It is blind, and its eyes are indeed altogether atrophied. The elytra are soldered at the median edge, so that it cannot spread its wings to fly. It is an animal predestined to the yoke; and for the rest its masters treat it with extreme kindness. The yellow ants, according to Müller,<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_64" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm64" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">64</a> have reduced this outcast beetle to domesticity, and it is almost a piece of good fortune for him to have lost his freedom and to have gained in exchange a shelter and a well-furnished trough. These insects are in fact cared for by their masters, who feed them by disgorging into their mouths the sweet liquids they have gathered here and there. If a nest is disturbed the ants hasten to carry their eggs and larvæ out of danger; they display the same solicitude with regard to the <em xml:lang="la">Claviger</em>, and carefully bear them to the depth of their galleries. It must not be believed <a id="page107" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="107"></a>that the practical insect takes so much care in order to repair the injustice of nature towards the beetle; the part of a devoted sick nurse would not suit him; he cares for the <em xml:lang="la">Claviger</em> because it is his property, a capital which brings in interest in the shape of excellent sweet little drops which are good to suck.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_65" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm65" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">65</a></p>
<p>A yellow ant, who wishes to enjoy the result of the cares given to his pensioner, approaches it and gently caresses it with his antennæ; the other shows signs of pleasure at this visit, and soon a pearly drop appears on the tuft of hairs at the edge of its elytra, and this the ant hastens to lick. The beetle is thus exploited and tickled by all the members of the community to which he belongs who meet him on their road. But when it has been milked two or three times it ceases to <a id="page108" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="108"></a>secrete. A solicitous ant arriving at this moment finds its efforts in vain, but still behaves like a good shepherd; it shows no impatience or anger towards its exhausted beast, knowing well that it is only necessary to come back a little later or to go to another member of the herd. Nor are his cares lessened by finding the source dried up. He foresees that it will still be good after repose, and if it is hungry he disgorges food for it.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_10">Degrees of civilisation in the same species of Ants.</em> — These facts are sufficiently marvellous in themselves, but are more surprising when we recollect that they cannot be regarded as an innate and unreflecting instinct with which all the individuals of the same species are endowed. The art of domesticating the <em xml:lang="la">Claviger</em> is a stage of civilisation reached by some tribes and not by others. Lespès<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_66" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm66" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">66</a> has placed this out of doubt in the following manner. He had specimens of <em xml:lang="la">Lasius niger</em> who exploited a flock of Coleoptera. Having met ants of the same species who possessed no flocks, he brought them some. At the sight of the little insects they threw themselves on them, killed them, and devoured them. If we compare these facts with those which pass in human societies, it will seem to us that these latter Hymenoptera behave like a horde of hunters in the presence of a flock of sheep, while the first have already arrived at the sheep-herding stage.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_11">Aphis-pens and paddocks.</em> — Ants can also keep Aphides in their homes. In this case, fearing that the adult beasts may not be able to adopt a change of surroundings and food, they bring the eggs to their <a id="page109" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="109"></a>nests and care for them at the same time as their own children. In time they come out and constitute a flock easy to tame. Other ants, still more intelligent, have discovered a method of holding the Aphides captive, while allowing them to enjoy their accustomed life, and to feed at will on the foods they prefer on their own favourite spots. It is sufficient for this purpose to establish barriers around a group of cattle who have themselves fixed the place of their sojourn. The <em xml:lang="la">Lasius niger</em>, a skilful architect, constructs vaulted passages from his dwelling into the country. These covered roads, built with earth moistened with saliva, have various ends; some have been made in order to reach remote work sheltered from the sun, or to give concealment from enemies. Many lead to the pens of the Aphides; they reach from the anthill as far as the foot of a plant where these insects are abundant. In order to have their milkers at their disposal, without removing them from pasture, the ants make tunnels along the stalk, and enclose within it all the Aphides they meet. They thus prevent any desire for a distant ramble. But in order that the flock may not be too closely confined, the <em xml:lang="la">Lasius niger</em> enlarge the galleries in places, and make a sort of chamber or stable in which the beasts may disport themselves at ease. These halls, which are proportionately very vast, are supported against the branches and leaves of the plant which bears up the walls and the vaults. The captives find themselves then with all the advantages of material life, and may be milked with every facility.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_67" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm67" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">67</a></p>
<p>An allied species of ant, the <em xml:lang="la">Lasius brunneus</em>, lives <a id="page110" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="110"></a>almost entirely on the sweet secretion of large Aphides in the bark of oaks and walnut trees. The ants construct around these insects cabins made of fragments of wood, and wall them in completely so as to keep them at their own disposal.</p>
<p>The <em xml:lang="la">Myrmica</em> also forms similar pasture lands; its system is rather less perfect than that of the <em xml:lang="la">Lasius</em>, as it does not form covered galleries to reach its stables. It is content to build large earth huts around a colony. A large hole, which allows the passage of the ants, but not the escape of the flock, is formed so that they may come to milk their cows. They use the same methods we have seen practised on the <em xml:lang="la">Claviger</em>, caressing the insect with their antennæ until the sugared drop appears.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_68" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm68" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">68</a></p>
<p>An example is quoted which shows still greater intelligence and foresight in Ants. They have been known to repopulate their territories after an epidemic, or at least after the destruction of their Aphides. The proprietor of a tree, finding it covered with these exploited beasts, cleared it of its inconvenient guests by repeated washes; but the dispossessed Hymenoptera, considering that this pasture close to their nest was very convenient for a flock, resolved to repopulate it, and for some time these tenacious insects could be seen bringing back among the foliage Aphides captured elsewhere.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_69" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm69" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">69</a></p>
<p><a id="page111" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="111"></a><em class="section_title" id="ch_4_12">Slavery among Ants.</em> — The custom of making slaves is widely spread in the ant world; I have already described the expeditions organised to obtain them. We will now consider the relations of these insects among themselves.</p>
<p>The <em xml:lang="la">Formica sanguinea</em> takes possession of the eggs of the <em xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em> and rears them with its own. When the slaves reach the adult condition they live beside their masters and share their labours, for the latter work, are skilful in all tasks, and can by their own activity construct an ant-hill and keep it going. If they desire servants, it is not in order to throw all the work on them, but to have intelligent assistants. This is the primitive form of slavery as it first existed among men. It was not until later that it became modified, to become at last an institution against which the sentiment of justice arose. Other species of Ants have pushed the exploitation of slaves to a point Man has never reached. But the <em xml:lang="la">Formica sanguinea</em> are companions to their helpers rather than masters, and even show them great consideration. When the colony emigrates one may see the owners of the nest, who are of larger size than the <em xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em>, take these up in their jaws and carry them the entire way.</p>
<p>The Amazons (<em xml:lang="la">Polyergus rufescens</em>) act otherwise. Very skilful in obtaining slaves and powerfully armed for triumphant raids, their nests always contain legions of servants, and the custom of being waited upon has become so impressed on the race by heredity that it is an instinct stronger even than personal preservation. The master ant has not only lost the taste and the idea of work, but even the habit of feeding himself, and would die of hunger beside a pile of <a id="page112" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="112"></a>honey or sugar if a grey ant was not there to put it into his mouth. Thus Huber, the earliest accurate observer of these ants, enclosed thirty Amazons with several pupæ and larvæ of their own species, and twenty negro pupæ, in a glass box, the bottom of which was covered with a thick layer of earth; honey was given to them, so that, although cut off from their auxiliaries, the Amazons had both shelter and food. At first they appeared to pay some little attention to the young; this soon ceased, and they neither traced out a dwelling nor took any food; in two days one-half died of hunger, and the other remained weak and languid. Commiserating their condition, he gave them <em>one</em> of their black companions. This little creature, unassisted, formed a chamber in the earth, gathered together the larvæ, put everything into complete order, and preserved the lives of those which were about to perish.</p>
<p>All their industry is expended in the acquisition of captives. The <em xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em> avoid introducing into their houses adults who would not become reconciled to the loss of liberty, and would prefer to die rather than work for others. They carry off the larvæ of <em xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em> and <em xml:lang="la">Formica cunicularia</em>. When brought into the ant-hill these larvæ are placed in the jaws of slaves of their own species, who care for them; they are born captives, and have neither the regret nor the idea of a free life. Among the Amazons the slaves undertake every labour; it is they who build and who care for the larvæ of their masters, as well as those carried away in expeditions. They have also complicated personal services towards the <em xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em>. They bring them food, lick off the dust from their hairs, clean them, carry them from one place to <a id="page113" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="113"></a>another, if there is need to emigrate, although they themselves are much smaller. The masters, by force of losing interest in work, lose also their votes when it is a question of taking a resolution concerning the whole colony. The servants act on their own initiative and their own responsibility, direct constructions according to their own ideas, and even in grave concerns, such as emigration, the idle masters do not seem to be consulted. The workers deliberate among themselves, and having come to a decision, proceed to execute it. They transport the household goods, the eggs, the future of the city, and the Amazons who have become its parasites. It is a most curious fact that the slaves should submit to this precarious fate when their masters are absolutely dependent on them. It is just to add that the robust mandibles of the latter may contribute to preserve the position they enjoy.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_70" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm70" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">70</a></p>
