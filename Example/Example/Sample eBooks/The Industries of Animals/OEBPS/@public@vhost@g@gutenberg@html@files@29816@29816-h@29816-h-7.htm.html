</div>
<p>An insect, the <em xml:lang="la">Xylocopa violacea</em> (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig22" id="fig22mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 22</a>), related to our Humble-bee, from which it differs in several anatomical characters, and by the dark violet tint of its wings, brings an improvement to the formation of the shelter which it makes in wood for its larvæ. Instead of hollowing a mere retreat to place there all its eggs indiscriminately, it divides them into compartments, separated by horizontal partitions. It is the female alone who accomplishes this task, connected with the function of perpetuating the race. She chooses an old tree-trunk, a pole, or the post of a fence, exposed to the sun and already worm-eaten, so that her labour may be lightened. She first attacks the wood perpendicularly to the surface, then suddenly turns and directs downwards the passage, the <a id="page169" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="169"></a> diameter of which is about equal to the size of the insect’s body. The <em xml:lang="la">Xylocopa</em> thus forms a tube about thirty centimetres in length. Quite at the bottom she places the first egg, leaving beside it a provision of honey necessary to nourish the larva during its evolution; she then closes it with a partition. This partition is made with fragments of the powder of wood glued together with saliva. A first horizontal ring is applied round the circumference of the tube; then in the interior of this first ring a second is formed, and so on continuously, until the central opening, more and more reduced, is at last entirely closed up. This ceiling forms the floor for the next chamber, in which the female deposits a new egg, provided, like the other, with abundant provisions. The same acts are repeated until the retreat becomes <a id="page170" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="170"></a>transformed into a series of isolated cells in which the larvæ can effect their development, and from which they will emerge either by themselves perforating a thin wall which separates them from daylight, or by an opening which the careful mother has left to allow them to attain liberty without trouble.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_87" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm87" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">87</a></p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_9">Woven dwellings.</em> — The second class of habitation, which I have called the woven dwelling, proceeds at first from the parcelling up of substances, then of objects capable of being entangled like wisps of wood or straw, then of fine and supple materials which the artisan can work together in a regular manner, that is to say by felting or weaving. Facts will show us the successive stages of improvement which have been introduced into this industry. I will begin with the more rudimentary.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_10">Rudiments of this industry.</em> — There are, first, cases in which the will of the animal does not intervene, or at least is very slightly manifested. The creature is found covered and protected by foreign bodies which are often living beings. Spider-crabs (<em xml:lang="la">Maïa</em>), for example, have their carapaces covered with algæ and hydroids of all sorts. Thus garnished, the Crustaceans have the advantage of not being recognised from afar when they go hunting, since beneath this fleece they resemble some rock. H. Fol has observed at Villefranche-sur-Mer a <em xml:lang="la">Maïa</em> so buried beneath this vegetation that it was impossible at first sight to distinguish it from the stones around. Under these conditions the animal submits to a shelter rather than creates it. Yet it is not so passive as one might at first be led to suppose. When the algæ which <a id="page171" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="171"></a>flourish on its back become too long and impede or delay its progress, it tears them off with its claws and thoroughly cleans itself. The carapace being quite clean, the animal finds itself too smooth and too easy to distinguish from surrounding objects; it therefore takes up again fragments of algæ and replaces them where they do not delay to take root like cuttings and to flourish anew. This culture is therefore intentional; the crab directs it and arrests its exuberance; it is no more the victim of it than the gardener is the slave of the vegetables which he waters day by day. From generation to generation this crab has acquired the habit, the instinct if one prefers, of thus covering itself so that it may be confused with neighbouring objects. Naturally it is ignorant of botany, and knows nothing of cuttings. If placed in an aquarium with little fragments of paper it will seize them and place them on its back, as it would have done with algæ, without troubling as to whether they become fixed or not. In spite of this lack of judgment, we cannot fail to recognise in this <em xml:lang="la">Maïa</em> a certain ingenuity in self-concealment.</p>
<div class="figright" id="fig23"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@images@th_fig_23.png" alt="A crab with a lumpy thing on its back." tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/>
<p class="caption"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig23mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 23.</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Sponge-crab (<em xml:lang="la">Dromia vulgaris</em>) also practises this method of shelter. It seizes a large sponge and maintains it firmly over its carapace with the help of the posterior pair of limbs. The sponge continues to prosper and to spread over the Crustacean who has adopted it. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig23" id="fig23mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 23.</a>) The two beings do not seem to be definitely fixed to each other; the contact of a sudden wave will separate them. When the divorce is effected, the <em xml:lang="la">Dromia</em> immediately throws itself on its cherished covering and replaces it. M. Künckel d’Herculais tells of one of these curious <a id="page172" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="172"></a> crustaceans which delighted the workers in the laboratory of Concarneau. The need for covering themselves experienced by these Crabs is so strong that in aquariums when their sponge is taken away they <a id="page173" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="173"></a>will apply to the back a fragment of wrack or of anything which comes to hand. A little white cloak with the arms of Brittany was manufactured for one of these captives, and it was very amusing to see him put on his overcoat when he had nothing else wherewith to cover himself.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_88" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm88" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">88</a></p>
<p>In these two cases which I have brought forward to exhibit the rudiments of this industry, the animals’ reflection and will play but a small part; even in the <em xml:lang="la">Dromia</em> custom is so inveterate in the race that it has reacted on the animal’s organisation, and its four posterior legs are profoundly modified for the purpose of firmly holding the sheltering sponge; they no longer serve for swimming or walking. The animals of which I have now to speak possess more initiative; although all do not act with the same success, or show themselves equally skilful. Let us turn first to the least experienced.</p>
<p>An Australian bird, the <em xml:lang="la">Catheturus Lathami</em>, as described by Gould, is still in the rudiments, and limits itself to preparing an enormous pile of leaves. It begins its work some weeks before laying its eggs; with its claws it pushes behind it all the dead leaves which fall on the earth and brings them into a heap. The bird throws new material on the summit until the hole is of suitable height. This detritus ferments when left to itself, and a gentle heat is developed in the centre of the edifice. The <em xml:lang="la">Catheturus</em> returns to lay near this coarse shelter; it then takes each egg and buries it in the heap, the larger end uppermost. It places a new layer above, and quits its labour for good. Incubation takes place favoured by the uniform heat of this decomposing <a id="page174" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="174"></a>mass, hatching is produced, and the young emerge from their primitive nest.</p>
<div class="figright" id="fig24"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@images@th_fig_24.png" alt="Several small objects that look like thimbles made of leaves." tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></a>
<p class="caption"><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig24mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 24.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Birds are not alone in constructing temporary dwellings in which to lay their eggs; some Fish are equally artistic in this kind of industry, and even certain Reptiles. The Alligator of the Mississippi would not perhaps at first be regarded as a model of maternal foresight. Yet the female constructs a genuine nest. She seeks a very inaccessible spot in the midst of brushwood and thickets of reeds. With her jaw she carries thither boughs which she arranges on the soil and covers with leaves. She lays her eggs and conceals them with care beneath vegetable remains. Not yet considering her work completed, she stays in the neighbourhood watching with jealous eye the thicket which shelters the dear deposit, and never ceases to mount guard threateningly until the day when her young ones can follow her into the stream.</p>
<p>A hymenopterous relative of the Bees, the <em xml:lang="la">Megachile</em>, cuts out in rose-leaves fragments of appropriate form which it bears away to a small hole in a tree, an abandoned mouse nest or some similar cavity. There it rolls them, works them up, and arranges them with much art, so as to manufacture what resemble thimbles, which it fills with honey and in which it lays.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_89" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm89" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">89</a> (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig24" id="fig24mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 24.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="page175" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="175"></a>The <em xml:lang="la">Anthocopa</em> acts in a similar manner, carpeting the holes of which it takes possession with the delicate petals of the corn poppy.</p>
<p>The retreats of nocturnal birds of prey do not differ in method of construction from these two kinds of nests. They are holes in trees, in ruins, in old walls, and are lined with soft and warm material. These dwellings are related, not to the type of the hollowed cave, but to that of the habitation manufactured from mingled materials. They constitute an inferior form in which the pieces are not firmly bound together but need support throughout. The cavity is the support which sustains the real house.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_11">Dwellings formed of coarsely-entangled materials.</em> — Diurnal birds of prey are the first animals who practise skilfully the twining of materials. Their nests, which have received the name of eyries, are not yet masterpieces of architecture, and reveal the beginning of the industry which is pushed so far by other birds. Usually situated in wild and inaccessible spots, the young are there in safety when their parents are away on distant expeditions. The abrupt summits of cliffs and the tops of the highest forest trees are the favourite spots chosen by the great birds of prey. The eyrie generally consists of a mass of dry branches which cross and mutually support one another, constituting a whole which is fairly resistant.</p>
<p>Even these primitive nests are not, however, without more complicated details of interest. Thus Mr. Denis Gale wrote to Bendire concerning the Golden Eagle in America: “Here in Colorado, in the numerous glades running from the valleys into the foothills, high inaccessible ledges are quite frequently met with which afford the Eagles secure sites for their <a id="page176" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="176"></a>enormous nests. I know of one nest that must contain two waggon-loads of material. It is over seven feet high, and quite six feet wide on its upper surface. In most cases the cliff above overhangs the site. At the end of February or the beginning of March, the needful repairs to the nest are attended to, and the universal branch of evergreen is laid upon the nest, seemingly for any purpose save that of utility. This feature has been present in all the nests I have examined myself, or have had examined by others; it would seem to be employed as a badge of occupancy.”<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_90" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm90" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">90</a> This curious feature is also found in the nests of the Bald or American Eagle. Thus Dr. W. L. Ralph furnished Bendire with the following observations made in Florida on the dwellings of this, the national bird of the United States: — “The nests are immense structures, from five to six feet in diameter, and about the same in depth, and so strong that a man can walk around in one without danger of breaking through; in fact, my assistant would always get in the nest before letting the eggs down to me. They are composed of sticks, some of which are two or three inches thick, and are lined with marsh grass or some similar material. There is usually a slight depression in the centre, where the eggs are placed, but the edge of the nest extends so far beyond this that it is almost impossible to see the bird from below, unless it has its head well up. I have frequently found foreign substances in their nests, usually placed on the edges of it, the object of which I cannot account for. Often it would be a ball of grass, wet or dry, sometimes a green branch from a pine tree, and again a piece of wood, bark, or other <a id="page177" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="177"></a>material. It seemed as if they were placed in the nests as if to mark them. From its frequent occurrence, at least, it seemed to me as if designedly done.”<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_91" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm91" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">91</a></p>
<p>The abodes of Squirrels, though exhibiting more art, are constructions of the same nature; that is to say, they are formed of interlaced sticks. This animal builds its home to shelter itself there in the bad season, to pass the night in it, and to rear its young. Very agile, and not afraid of climbing, it places its domicile near the tops of our highest forest trees. Rather capricious also, and desiring change of residence from time to time, it builds several of them; at least three or four, sometimes more. The materials which it needs are collected on the earth among fallen dead branches, or are torn away from the old abandoned nest of a crow or some other bird. The Squirrel firsts builds a rather hollow floor by intermingling the fragments of wood which it has brought. In this state its dwelling resembles a magpie’s nest. But the fastidious little animal wishes to be better protected and not thus to sleep in the open air. Over this foundation he raises a conical roof; the sticks which form it are very skilfully disposed, and so well interlaced that the whole is impenetrable to rain. The house must still be furnished, and this is done with oriental luxury; that is to say, the entire furniture consists of a carpet, a carpet of very dry moss, which the Squirrel tears from the trunks of trees, and which it piles up so as to have a soft and warm couch. An entrance situated at the lower part gives access to the aërial castle; it is usually directed towards the east. On the opposite side there is <a id="page178" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="178"></a>another orifice by which the animal can escape if an enemy should invade the principal entrance. In ordinary times also it serves to ventilate the chamber by setting up a slight current of air. The Squirrel greatly fears storms and rain, and during bad weather hastens to take refuge in his dwelling. If the wind blows in the direction of the openings, the little beast at once closes them with two stoppers of moss, and keeps well shut in as long as the storm rages.</p>
<p>The great Anthropoid Apes have found nothing better for shelter than the Squirrels’ method. It must, however, be taken into account that they have much more difficulty in arranging and maintaining much heavier rooms, and in building up a shelter with larger surface.</p>
<p>The Orang-outang, which lives in the virgin forests of the Sunda Archipelago, does not feel the need of constructing a roof against the rain. He is content with a floor established in the midst of a tree, and made of broken and interlaced branches. He piles up on this support a considerable mass of leaves and moss; for the Orang does not sleep seated like the other great apes, but lies down in the manner of Man, as has often been observed when he is in captivity. When he feels the cold he is ingenious enough to cover himself with the leaves of his couch.</p>
<p>In Upper and Lower Guinea the Chimpanzee (<em xml:lang="la">Troglodytes niger</em>) also establishes his dwelling on trees. He first makes choice of a large horizontal branch, which constitutes a sufficient floor for the agile animal. Above this branch he bends the neighbouring boughs, crosses them, and interlaces them so as to obtain a sort of framework. When <a id="page179" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="179"></a>this preliminary labour is accomplished, he collects dead wood or breaks up branches and adds them to the first. Before commencing he had taken care when choosing the site that the whole was so arranged that a fork was within reach to sustain the roof. He thus constructs a very sufficient shelter. These apes are sociable and prefer to live in each other’s neighbourhood. They even go on excursions in rather large bands. Notwithstanding this, more than one or two cabins are never seen on the same tree; perhaps this is because the complicated conditions required for the construction are not likely to be realised several times on the same tree; perhaps also it is a desire for independence which impels the Chimpanzees not to live too near to each other.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_92" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm92" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">92</a></p>
<p>The <em xml:lang="la">Troglodytes calvus</em>, a relative of the preceding, inhabiting the same regions, as described by Du Chaillu, shows still more skill in raising his roof. A tree is always chosen for support. He breaks off boughs and fastens them by one end to the trunk, by the other to a large branch. To fix all these pieces he employs very strong creepers, which grow in abundance in his forests. Above this framework, which indicates remarkable ingenuity, the animal piles up large leaves, forming in layers well pressed down and quite impenetrable to the rain. The whole has the appearance of an open parasol. The ape sits on a branch beneath his handiwork, supporting himself against the trunk with one arm. He has thus an excellent shelter against the mid-day sun as well as against tropical showers. Male and female each <a id="page180" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="180"></a>possess a dwelling on two neighbouring trees, the principle of conjugal cohabitation not being admitted in this species. As to the child, it appears that it sleeps near its mother, until it is of age to lead an independent life.</p>
<p>There exists in Australia, the country of zoological singularities, a bird with very curious customs. This is the Satin Bower-bird. The art displayed in this bird’s constructions is not less interesting than the sociability he gives evidence of, and his desire to have for his hours of leisure a shelter adorned to his taste. The bowers which he constructs, and which present on a small scale the appearance of the arbours in our old gardens, are places for re-union and for warbling and courtship, in which the birds stay during the day, when no anxiety leads them to disperse. They are not, properly speaking, nests built for the purpose of rearing young; for at the epoch of love each couple separates and constructs a special retreat in the neighbourhood of the bower. These shelters are always situated in the most retired parts of the forest, and are placed on the earth at the foot of trees. Several couples work together to raise the edifice, the males performing the chief part of the work. At first they establish a slightly convex floor, made with interlaced sticks, intended to keep the place sheltered from the moisture of the soil. The arbour rises in the centre of this first platform. Boughs vertically arranged are interlaced at the base with those of the floor. The birds arrange them in two rows facing each other; they then curve together the upper extremities of these sticks, and fix them so as to obtain a vault. All the prominences in the materials employed are turned towards the outside, so that the <a id="page181" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="181"></a>interior of the room may be smooth and the birds may not catch their plumage in it. This done, the little architects, to embellish their retreat, transport to it a number of conspicuous objects, such as very white stones from a neighbouring stream, shells, the bright feathers of the parroquet, whatever comes to their beak. All these treasures are arranged on the earth, before the two entries to the bower, so as to form on each side a carpet, which is not smooth, but the varied colours of which rejoice the eye. The prettiest treasures are fixed into the wall of the hut. These houses of pleasure, with all their adornments, form a dwelling very much to the taste of this winged folk, and the birds pass there the greater part of the day, preening their feathers and narrating the news of the forest. Bower-birds’ clubs are drawing-rooms raised at the common expense by all who frequent them. The Spotted Bower-bird, the <em xml:lang="la">Chlamydera maculata</em>, which also lives in the interior of Australia, exercises this method of construction with equal success. The bowers built by these birds may be one metre in length; this is on a very luxurious scale, the animal itself only measuring twenty-five centimetres. In this species, as among other Bower-birds, the bowers are not the labour and the property of a single couple; they are the result of the collaboration of several households, who come together to shelter themselves there. These birds feed only on grains, so that it is to a very pronounced taste for collecting that we must attribute this mania of piling up before the entrance of the bower white stones, shells, and small bones. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig25" id="fig25mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 25.</a>) These objects are intended solely for the delight of these feathered artists. They are very <a id="page182" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="182"></a>careful also only to collect pieces which have been whitened and dried by the sun.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_93" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm93" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">93</a></p>
<p>Certain Humming-birds also, according to Gould, decorate their dwellings with great taste. “They instinctively fasten thereon,” he stated, “beautiful pieces of flat lichen, the larger pieces in the middle, and the smaller on the part attached to the branch. Now and then a pretty feather is intertwined or fastened to the outer sides, the stem being always so placed that the feather stands out beyond the surface.”<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_94" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm94" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">94</a></p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_12">Dwellings woven of flexible substances.</em> — In spite of their lack of skill and the inadequacy of their organs for this kind of work, Fish are not the most awkward architects. The species which construct nests for laying in are fairly numerous; the classical case of the Stickleback is always quoted, but this is not the only animal of its class to possess the secret of the manufacture of a shelter for its eggs.</p>
<p>A fish of Java, the Gourami (<em xml:lang="la">Osphronemus olfax</em>), establishes an ovoid nest with the leaves of aquatic plants woven together. It makes its work about the size of a fist, takes no rest until it is completed, and is able to finish it in five or six days. It is the male alone who weaves this dwelling; when it is ready a female comes to lay there, and generally fills it; it may contain from six hundred to a thousand eggs.</p>
<div class="figcenter" id="fig25"><a id="page183" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="183"></a> <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@images@th_fig_25.png" alt="A dark bird stands before a nest that has a pile of shells in front of it." tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></a>

</div>
<p>In the sea of Sargasso lives a fish which has received the name of the <em xml:lang="la">Antennarius marmoratus</em>. Its <a id="page184" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="184"></a>flattened and monstrous head gives it a strange aspect, and it is marbled with brown and yellow. These colours are those of the tufts of floating seaweed around it, and, thanks to this arrangement, it can easily hide itself amid them without being recognised from afar. This animal constructs for its offspring a fairly safe retreat. The materials which it employs are tufts of Sargasso so abundant in this portion of the Atlantic. It collects all the filaments, and unites them solidly by surrounding them with viscous mucus which it secretes and which hardens. When its work is sufficiently firm not to be destroyed by the waves it lays its eggs in it, and the floating nest is abandoned to its fate. The little ones come out and find within it a sufficient protection for their early age. These dwellings thus floating on the surface of the sea are rounded and about the size of a cocoa-nut.</p>
<p>In Guiana and Brazil another species, the <em xml:lang="la">Chœstostomus pictus</em>, is found, which is equally skilful. With aquatic plants it constructs a spherical nest and arranges it in the midst of the reeds, level with the water. At the lower part a hole is left, through which the female comes to lay. After fertilisation, the couple, as is rarely found among fish, remain in the neighbourhood of their offspring to assist them if necessary. This praiseworthy sentiment is often the cause of their ruin. The inhabitants of the banks speculate on the love of these fish for their offspring to gain possession of them. It is sufficient to place a basket near the entrance of the dwelling, which is then lightly struck. The animal, threatened in its affections, darts furiously forward with bristling spines and throws itself into the trap.</p>
<p><a id="page185" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="185"></a>It is scarcely necessary to recall the skilful art with which the Stickleback which inhabits all our streams plaits its nest and remains sentinel near it. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig26" id="fig26mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 26.</a>) This fish has indeed monopolised our admiration, and is considered as the most skilful, if not the only aquatic architect. Yet, besides those which I have already mentioned, there is one which equals the Stickleback in the skill it displays in constructing a shelter for its spawn. This is the <em xml:lang="la">Gobius niger</em> met on our coasts, especially in the estuaries of rivers. The male interlaces and weaves the leaves of algæ, etc., and when he has finished his preparations, he goes to seek females, and leads them one by one to lay in the retreat he has built. Then he remains in the neighbourhood until the young come out, ready to throw himself furiously with his spines on any imprudent intruders.</p>

<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_13">Dwellings woven with greater art.</em> — Without doubt the class of Birds furnishes the most expert artisans in the industry of the woven dwelling. In our own country we may see them seeking every day to right and left, carrying a morsel of straw, a pinch of moss, a hair from a horse’s tail, or a tuft of wool caught in a bush. They intermingle these materials, making the framework of the construction with the coarser pieces, keeping those that are warmer and more delicate for the interior. These nests, attached to a fork in a branch or in a shrub, hidden in the depth of a thicket, are little masterpieces of skill and patience. To describe every form and every method would fill a volume. But I cannot pass in silence those which reveal a science sure of itself, and which are not very inferior to what man can do in this line. The Lithuanian Titmouse (<em xml:lang="la">Ægithalus pendulinus</em>), whose <a id="page187" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="187"></a>works have been well described by Baldamus, lives in the marshes in the midst of reeds and willows in Poland, Galicia, and Hungary. Its nest, which resembles none met in our own country, is always suspended above the water, two or three metres above the surface, fixed to a willow branch.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_95" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm95" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">95</a> All individuals do not exhibit the same skill in fabricating their dwelling; some are more careful and clever than others who are less experienced. Some also are obliged by circumstances to hasten their work. It frequently happens that Magpies spoil or even altogether destroy with blows of their beaks one of these pretty nests. The unfortunate couple are obliged to recommence their task, and if this accident happens two or three times to the same household, it can easily be imagined that, discouraged and depressed by the advancing season, they hasten to build a shelter anyhow, only doing what is indispensable, and neglecting perfection. However this may be, the nests which are properly finished have the form of a purse, twenty centimetres high and twelve broad. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig27" id="fig27mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 27.</a>) At the side an opening, prolonged by a passage which is generally horizontal, gives access to the interior. Sometimes another opening is found without any passage. Every nest in the course of construction possessed this second entry, but it is usually filled up when the work is completed. When the bird has resolved to establish its retreat, it first chooses a hanging branch presenting bifurcations which can be utilised as a rigid frame on which to weave the lateral walls of the habitation. It intercrosses wool and goat’s hair so as to form two courses which are afterwards united to each other below, and <a id="page189" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="189"></a>constitute the first sketch of the nest, at this moment like a flat-bottomed basket. This is only the beginning. The whole wall is reinforced by the addition of new material. The architect piles up down from the poplar and the willow, and binds it all together with filaments torn from the bark of trees, so as to make a whole which is very resistant. Then a couch is formed by heaping up wool and down at the bottom of the nest.</p>

<p>The American Baltimore Oriole, also called the Baltimore Bird, is a distinguished weaver. With strong stalks and hemp or flax, fastened round two forked twigs corresponding to the proposed width of nest, it makes a very delicate sort of mat, weaving into it quantities of loose tow. The form of the nest might be compared to that of a ham; it is attached by the narrow portion to a small branch, the large part being below. An opening exists at the lower end of the dwelling, and the interior is carefully lined with soft substances, well interwoven with the outward netting, and it is finished with an external layer of horse-hair, while the whole is protected from sun and rain by a natural canopy of leaves.</p>

</div>
<p>The Rufous-necked Weaver Bird, as described by Brehm, shows itself equally clever. Its nest is woven with extreme delicacy, and resembles a long-necked decanter hung up with the opening below. From the bottom of the decanter a strong band attaches the whole to the branch of a tree. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig28" id="fig28mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 28.</a>) The Yellow Weaver Bird of Java, as described by Forbes, constructs very similar retort-shaped nests.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_96" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm96" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">96</a></p>
<p>These birds have no monopoly of these careful <a id="page190" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="190"></a>dwellings; a considerable number of genera have carried this industry to the same degree of perfection.</p>

<p>When animals apply themselves in association to any work, they nearly always exhibit in it a marked superiority over neighbouring species among whom the individuals work in isolation. The construction of dwellings is no exception, and the nests of the Sociable Weaver Birds of South Africa are the best constructed that can be found. These birds live together in considerable colonies; the members of an association are at least two hundred in number, and sometimes rise to five hundred. The city which they construct is a <a id="page191" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="191"></a>marvel of industry. They first make with grass a sloping roof; giving it the form of a mushroom or an open umbrella, and they place it in such a way that it is supported by the trunk of a tree and one or two of the branches. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig29" id="fig29mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 29.</a>) This thatch is prepared with so much care that it is absolutely impenetrable to water. Beneath this protecting shelter each couple constructs its private dwelling. All the individual nests have their openings below, and they <a id="page192" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="192"></a>are so closely pressed against one another that on looking at the construction from beneath, the divisions cannot be seen. One only perceives a surface riddled with holes like a skimmer; each of these holes is the door of a nest. The work may endure for several years; as long as there is room beneath the roof the young form pairs near their cradle; but at last, as the colony continues to increase, a portion emigrate to found a new town on another tree in the forest.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_97" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm97" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">97</a></p>

<p>The industry of the woven dwelling does not flourish among mammals; but there is one which excels in it. This is the Dwarf Mouse (<em xml:lang="la">Mus minutus</em>), certainly one of the smallest Rodents. It generally lives amidst reeds and rushes, and it is perhaps this circumstance which has impelled it to construct an aërial dwelling for its young, not being able to deposit them on the damp and often flooded soil. This retreat is not used in every season; its sole object is for bringing forth the young. It is therefore a genuine nest, not only by the manner in which it is made, but by the object it is intended to serve. The mouse chooses in the midst of its usual domain a tuft with leaves more or less crossed; but not too inextricable, so that there may remain in the midst an empty space, in the centre of which the work will be arranged. Great ingenuity is shown in the preliminaries; the mouse simplifies its task by utilising material within its reach instead of going afar to collect them with trouble. The little animal examines the thicket, and on reflection chooses some <a id="page193" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="193"></a>thirty leaves which appear suitable. Then, without detaching them, it tears each into seven or eight threads which are held together by the base, and remain attached to the reeds. It is a clever idea to avoid losing a natural point of support. The little bands being thus prepared, they are interlaced and crossed with much art, the animal comes and goes, placing first one of them, then another above, taken from a different leaf. It has soon woven a ball about <a id="page194" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="194"></a>the size of the fist, and hollowed out the interior. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig30" id="fig30mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 30.</a>) Delicate materials are not lacking around to make a soft bed. The mouse gleans and constantly brings in the light down of the willow, grains with cottony crests, and the petals of flowers. This is all carefully fitted, and when the edifice is completed the female retires into it to bring forth her young, which are there well sheltered against the dangers without, and the caprices of storms and floods. The nest is made with as much delicacy as that of any bird, and no other mammal except Man is capable of executing such weaver’s work.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_14">The art of sewing among birds.</em> — There are birds which have succeeded in solving a remarkable difficulty. Sewing seems so ingenious an art that it must be reserved for the human species alone. Yet the Tailor Bird, the <em xml:lang="la">Orthotomus longicauda</em>, and other species possess the elements of it. They place their nests in a large leaf which they prepare to this end. With their beaks they pierce two rows of holes along the two edges of the leaf; they then pass a stout thread from one side to the other alternately. With this leaf, at first flat, they form a horn in which they weave their nest with cotton or hair. (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig31" id="fig31mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 31.</a>) These labours of weaving and sewing are preceded by the spinning of the thread. The bird makes it itself by twisting in its beak spiders’ webs, bits of cotton, and little ends of wool. Sykes found that the threads used for sewing were knotted at the ends.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_98" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm98" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">98</a> It is impossible not to admire animals who have skilfully triumphed over all the obstacles met with in the course of these complicated operations.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_99" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm99" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">99</a></p>

</div>
<p><a id="page195" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="195"></a>Certain Spiders, while they do not actually sew in the sense that they perforate the leaves they use to build their nest, and draw the thread through them, yet subject the leaves to an operation <a id="page196" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="196"></a>which cannot well be called anything else but sewing it.<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-10.htm.html#footnote_100" class="fnmarker pginternal" id="fnm100" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">100</a></p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_15">Modifications of dwellings according to season and climate.</em> — A certain number of facts show that these various industries are not fixed and immutable instincts imposed on the species. Certain Birds change the form of their dwelling according to the climate, or according to the season in which they inhabit it. For example, the Crossbill, <em xml:lang="la">Loxia tænioptera</em> (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@29816-h-7.htm.html#fig32" id="fig32mark" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 32</a>), does not build its nest according to the same rules in Sweden as in France. It builds in every season. The winter shelter is spherical, constructed with very dry lichens, and it is very large. A very narrow opening, just sufficient for the passage of the owner, prevents the external cold from penetrating within. The summer nests are much smaller, in consequence of a reduction in the thickness of the walls. There is no longer need to fear that the cold will come through them, and the animal gives itself no superfluous trouble.</p>
<div class="figleft" id="fig32"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@29816@29816-h@images@th_fig_32.png" alt="A dark bird with white bars on its wings sits on a fir branch." tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></a>

</div>
<p>Again, the Baltimore Oriole, which inhabits both the Northern and Southern States of North America, knows very well how to adapt his manner of work to the external circumstances in which he lives. Thus, in the Southern States the nest is woven of delicate materials united in a rather loose fashion, so that the air can circulate freely and keep the interior fresh; it is lined with no warm substance, and the entrance is turned to the west so that the sun only sends into it the oblique evening rays. In the north, on the contrary, the nest is oriented to the south to profit by all the warm sunshine; the walls are thick, without <a id="page197" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="197"></a>interstices, and the dwelling is carpeted in the warmest and softest manner. Even in the same region there is great diversity in the style, neatness, and finish of the nests, as well as in the materials used. Skeins of silk and hanks of thread have frequently been found in the Baltimore Bird’s nest, so woven up and entangled that they could not be withdrawn. As such materials could not be obtained before the introduction of Europeans, it is evident that this bird, with the sagacity of a good architect, knows how to select the strongest and best materials for his work. Many other facts might be quoted, but these suffice to show that the species is not animated by an inevitable instinct, but that each individual, skilful no doubt by heredity, can modify the <a id="page198" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="198"></a>methods transmitted to him by his ancestors, according to his own experience and his own judgment.</p>
<p><em class="section_title" id="ch_6_16">Built dwellings.</em> — The built dwelling, the expression of the highest civilisation, still remains to be studied. Man has only known how to construct this kind of shelter at a comparatively late period in his evolution; and among animals we do not find it widely spread, much less so, certainly, than the two foregoing methods, especially the first. The difficulty of this work is greater, and it only arrives at considerable development among very sociable species, since the united efforts of a great number of individuals are needed to carry it on.</p>
<p>There are, however, masons who operate separately; but their constructions are rudimentary. The characteristic of all these works is that they are manufactured with some substance to which the animal gives a determined form while it is still soft, and that in drying it preserves this form and acquires solidity. The matter most usually employed is softened and tempered earth — mortar; but there are animals who use with success more delicate bodies. Two examples will suffice to indicate the nature of these exceptions: the labours of Wasps and those of certain Swallows.</p>
