<p class="c1">In which the Voyager discourses on the legal methods of natives of this country, the ideas governing forms of burial, of their manner of mourning for their dead, and the condition of the African soul in the under-world.</p>
<p>Great as are the incidental miseries and dangers surrounding death to all the people in the village in which a death occurs, undoubtedly those who suffer most are the widows of a chief or free man.</p>
<p>The uniform custom among both Negroes and Bantus is that those who escape execution on the charge of having witched the husband to death, shall remain in a state of filth and abasement, not even removing vermin from themselves, until after the soul-burial is complete - the soul of the dead man being regarded as hanging about them and liable to be injured.  Therefore, also to the end of preventing his soul from getting damaged, they are confined to their huts; this latter restriction is not rigidly enforced, but it is held theoretically to be the correct thing.</p>
<p>They maintain the attitude of grief and abasement, sitting on the ground, eating but little food, and that of a coarse kind.  In Calabar their legal rights over property, such as slaves, are meanwhile considerably in abeyance, and they are put to great expense during the time the spirit is awaiting burial.  They have to keep watch, two at a time, in the hut, where the body is buried, keeping lights burning, and they have to pay out of their separate estate for the entertainment of all the friends of the deceased who come to pay him compliment; and if he has been an important man, a big man, the whole district will come, not in a squadron, but just when it suits them, exactly as if they were calling on a live friend.  Thus it often happens that even a big woman is bankrupt by the expense.  I will not go into the legal bearings of the case here, for they are intricate, and, to a great extent, only interesting to a student of Negro law.</p>
<p>The Bantu women occupy a far inferior position in regard to the rights of property to that held by the Negro women.</p>
<p>The disposal of wives after the death of the husband among the M’pongwe and Igalwa is a subject full of interest; but it is, like most of their law, very complicated.  The brothers of the deceased are supposed to take them - the younger brother may not marry the elder brother’s widows, but the elder brothers may marry those of the younger brother.  Should any of the women object to the arrangement, they may “leave the family.”</p>
<p>I own that the ground principle of African law practically is “the simple plan that they should take who have the power, and they should keep who can,” and this tells particularly against women and children who have not got living, powerful relations of their own.  Unless the children of a man are grown up and sufficiently powerful on their own account, they have little chance of sharing in the distribution of his estate; but in spite of this abuse of power there is among Negroes and Bantus a definite and acknowledged Law, to which an appeal can be made by persons of all classes, provided they have the wherewithal to set the machinery of it in motion.  The difficulty the children and widows have in sharing in the distribution of the estate of the father and husband arises, I fancy, in the principle of the husband’s brothers being the true heir, which has sunk into a fossilised state near the trading stations in the face of the white culture.  The reason for this inheritance of goods passing from the man to his brother by the same mother has no doubt for one of its origins the recognition of the fact that the brother by the same mother must be a near relation, whereas, in spite of the strict laws against adultery, the relationship to you of the children born of your wives is not so certain.  Nevertheless this is one of the obvious and easy explanations for things it is well to exercise great care before accepting, for you must always remember that the African’s mind does not run on identical lines with the European - what may be self-evident to you is not so to him, and <i>vice versa</i>.  I have frequently heard African metaphysicians complain that white men make great jumps in their thought-course, and do not follow an idea step by step.  You soon become conscious of the careful way a Negro follows his idea.  Certain customs of his you can, by the exercise of great patience, trace back in a perfectly smooth line from their source in some natural phenomenon.  Others, of course, you cannot, the traces of the intervening steps of the idea having been lost, owing partly to the veneration in which old customs are held, which causes them to regard the fact that their fathers had this fashion as reason enough for their having it, and above all to the total absence of all but oral tradition.  But so great a faith have I in the lack of inventive power in the African, that I feel sure all their customs, had we the material that has slipped down into the great swamp of time, could be traced back either, as I have said, to some natural phenomenon, or to the thing being advisable, for reasons of utility.</p>
<p>The uncertainty in the parentage of offspring may seem to be such a utilitarian underlying principle, but, on the other hand, it does not sufficiently explain the varied forms of the law of inheritance, for in some tribes the eldest or most influential son does succeed to his father’s wealth; in other places you have the peculiar custom of the chief slave inheriting.  I think, from these things, that the underlying idea in inheritance of property is the desire to keep the wealth of “the house,” <i>i.e</i>. estate, together, and if it were allowed to pass into the hands of weak people, like women and young children, this would not be done.  Another strong argument against the theory that it arises from the doubtful relationship of the son, is that certain ju-ju always go to the son of the chief wife, if he is old enough, at the time of the father’s death, even in those tribes where the wealth goes elsewhere.</p>
<p>Certain tribes acknowledge the right of the women and children to share in the dead man’s wealth, given that these are legally married wives, or the children of legally married wives; it is so in Cameroons, for example.  An esteemed friend of mine who helps to manage things for the Fatherland down there was trying a palaver the other day with a patience peculiar to him, and that intelligent and elaborate care I should think only a mind trained on the methods of German metaphysicians could impart into that most wearisome of proceedings, wherein every one says the same thing over fourteen different times at least, with a similar voice and gesture, the only variation being in the statements regarding the important points, and the facts of the case, these varying with each individual.  This palaver was made by a son claiming to inherit part of his father’s property; at last, to the astonishment, and, of course, the horror, of the learned judge, the defendant, the wicked uncle, pleaded through the interpreter, “This man cannot inherit his father’s property, because his parents married for love.”  There is no encouragement to foolishness of this kind in Cameroon, where legal marriage consists in purchase.</p>
<p>In Bonny River and in Opobo the inheritance of “the house” is settled primarily by a vote of the free men of the house; when the chief dies, their choice has to be ratified by the other chiefs of houses; but in Bonny and Opobo the white traders have had immense influence for a long time, so one cannot now find out how far this custom is purely native in idea.</p>
<p>Among the Fans the uncle is, as I have before said, an important person although the father has more rights than among the Igalwa, and here I came across a peculiar custom regarding widows.  M. Jacot cited to me a similar case or so, one of which I must remark was in an Ajumba town.  The widows were inside the dead husband’s hut, as usual; the Fan huts are stoutly built of sheets of flattened bark, firmly secured together with bark rope, and thatched - they never build them in any other way except when they are in the bush rubber-collecting or elephant-hunting, when they make them of the branches of trees.  Well, round the bark hut, with the widows inside, there was erected a hut made of branches, and when this was nearly completed, the Fans commenced pulling down the inner bark hut, and finally cleared it right out, thatch and all, and the materials of which it had been made were burnt.  I was struck with the performance because the Fans, though surrounded by intensely superstitious tribes, are remarkably free from superstition <a id="citation338"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote338" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{338}</a> themselves, taking little or no interest in speculative matters, except to get charms to make them invisible to elephants, to keep their feet in the path, to enable them to see things in the forest, and practical things of that sort, and these charms they frequently gave me to assist and guard me in my wanderings.</p>
<p>The M’pongwe and Igalwa have a peculiar funeral custom, but it is not confined in its operation to widows, all the near relatives sharing in it.  The mourning relations are seated on the floor of the house, and some friend - Dr. Nassau told me he was called in in this capacity - comes in and “lifts them up,” bringing to them a small present, a factor of which is always a piece of soap.  This custom is now getting into the survival form in Libreville and Glass.  Nowadays the relatives do not thus sit, unwashed and unkempt, keenly requiring the soap.  Among the bush Igalwa, I am told, the soap is much wanted.</p>
<p>It is not only the widows that remain, either theoretically or practically unwashed; all the mourners do.  The Ibibios seem to me to wear the deepest crape in the form of accumulated dirt, and all the African tribes I have met have peculiar forms of hair cutting - shaving the entire head, not shaving it at all, shaving half of it, etc. - when in mourning.  The period of the duration of wearing mourning is, I believe, in all West Coast tribes that which elapses between the death and the burial of the soul.  I believe a more thorough knowledge would show us that there is among the Bantu also a fixed time for the lingering of the soul on earth after death, but we have not got sufficient evidence on the point yet.  The only thing we know is that it is not proper for the widow to re-marry while her husband’s soul is still in her vicinity.</p>
<p>Among the Calabar tribes the burial of his spirit liberates the woman.  Among the Tschwi she requires special ceremonies on her own account.  In Togoland, among the Ewe people, I know the period is between five and six weeks, during which time the widow remains in the hut, armed with a good stout stick, as a precaution against the ghost of her husband, so as to ward off attacks should he be ill-tempered.  After these six weeks the widow can come out of the hut, but as his ghost has not permanently gone hence, and is apt to revisit the neighbourhood for the next six months, she has to be taken care of during this period.  Then, after certain ceremonies, she is free to marry again.  So I conclude the period of mourning, in all tribes, is that period during which the soul remains round its old possessions, whether these tribes have a definite soul-burial or devil-making or not.</p>
<p>The ideas connected with the under-world to which the ghost goes are exceedingly interesting.  The Negroes and Bantus are at one on these subjects in one particular only, and that is that no marriages take place there.  The Tschwis say that this under-world, Srahmandazi, is just the same as this world in all other particulars, save that it is dimmer, a veritable shadow-land where men have not the joys of life, but only the shadow of the joy.  Hence, says the Tschwi proverb, “One day in this world is worth a year in Srahmandazi.”  The Tschwis, with their usual definiteness in this sort of detail, know all about their Srahmandazi.  Its entrance is just east of the middle Volta, and the way down is difficult to follow, and when the sun sets on this world it rises on Srahmandazi.  The Bantus are vague on this important and interesting point.  The Benga, for example, although holding the absence of marriage there, do not take steps to meet the case as the Tschwis do, and kill a supply of wives to take down with them.  This reason for killing wives at a funeral is another instance that, however strange and cruel a custom may be here in West Africa, however much it may at first appear to be the flower of a rootless superstition, you will find on close investigation that it has some root in a religious idea, and a common-sense element.  The common-sense element in the killing of wives and slaves among both the Tschwi and the Calabar tribes consists in the fact that it discourages poisoning.  A Calabar chief elaborately explained to me that the rigorous putting down of killing at funerals that was being carried on by the Government not only landed a man in the next world as a wretched pauper, but added an additional chance to his going there prematurely, for his wives and slaves, no longer restrained by the prospect of being killed at his death and sent off with him would, on very slight aggravation, put “bush in his chop.”  It is sad to think of this thorn being added to the rose-leaves of a West Coast chief’s life, as there are 99.9 per cent. of thorns in it already.</p>
<p>I came across a similar case on the Gold Coast, when a chief complained to me of the way the Government were preserving vermin, in the shape of witches, in the districts under its surveillance.  You were no longer allowed to destroy them as of old, and therefore the vermin were destroying the game; for, said he, the witches here live almost entirely on the blood they suck from children at night.  They used, in old days, to do this furtively, and do so now where native custom is unchecked; but in districts where the Government says that witchcraft is utter nonsense, and killing its proficients utter murder which will be dealt with accordingly, the witch flourishes exceedingly, and blackmails the fathers and mothers of families, threatening that if they are not bought off they will have their child’s blood; and if they are not paid, the child dies away gradually - poison again, most likely.</p>
<p>I often think it must be the common-sense element in fetish customs that enables them to survive, in the strange way they do, in the minds of Africans who have been long under European influence and education.  In witching, for example, every intelligent native knows there is a lot of poison in the affair, but the explanation he gives you will not usually display this knowledge, and it was not until I found the wide diffusion of the idea of the advisability of administering an emetic to the bewitched person, that I began to suspect my black friends of sound judgment.</p>
<p>The good ju-juist will tell you all things act by means of their life, which means their power, their spirit.  Dr. Nassau tells me the efficacy of drugs is held to depend on their benevolent spirits, which, on being put into the body, drive away the malevolent disease-causing spirits - a leucocytes-versus-pathogenic-bacteria sort of influence, I suppose.  On this same idea also depends the custom of the appeal to ordeal, the working of which is supposed to be spiritual.  Nevertheless, the intelligent native, believing all the time in this factor, squares the commonsense factor by bribing the witch-doctor who makes the ordeal drink.</p>
<p>The feeling regarding the importance of funeral observances is quite Greek in its intensity.  Given a duly educated African, I am sure that he would grasp the true inwardness of the Antigone far and away better than any European now living can.  A pathetic story which bears on this feeling was told me some time ago by Miss Slessor when she was stationed at Creek Town.  An old blind slave woman was found in the bush, and brought into the mission.  She was in a deplorable state, utterly neglected and starving, her feet torn by thorns and full of jiggers, and so on.  Every care was taken of her and she soon revived and began to crawl about, but her whole mind was set on one thing with a passion that had made her alike indifferent to her past sufferings and to her present advantages.  What she wanted was a bit, only a little bit, of white cloth.  Now, I may remark, white cloth is anathema to the Missions, for it is used for ju-ju offerings, and a rule has to be made against its being given to the unconverted, or the missionary becomes an accessory before the fact to pagan practices, so white cloth the old woman was told she could not have, she had been given plenty of garments for her own use and that was enough.  The old woman, however, kept on pleading and saying the spirit of her dead mistress kept coming to her asking and crying for white cloth, and white cloth she must get for her, and so at last, finding it was not to be got at the Mission station, she stole away one day, unobserved, and wandered off into the bush, from which she never again reappeared, doubtless falling a victim to the many leopards that haunted hereabouts.</p>
<p>To provide a proper burial for the dead relation is the great duty of a negro’s life, its only rival in his mind is the desire to avoid having a burial of his own.  But, in a good negro, this passion will go under before the other, and he will risk his very life to do it.  He may know, surely and well, that killing slaves and women at a dead brother’s grave means hanging for him when their Big Consul knows of it, but in the Delta he will do it.  On the Coast, Leeward and Windward, he will spend every penny he possesses and, on top, if need be, go and pawn himself, his wives, or his children into slavery to give a deceased relation a proper funeral.</p>
<p>This killing at funerals I used to think would be more easily done away with in the Delta than among the Tschwi tribes, but a little more knowledge of the Delta’s idea about the future life showed me I was wrong.</p>
<p>Among the Tschwi the slaves and women killed are to form for the dead a retinue, and riches wherewith to start life in Srahmandazi (Yboniadse of the Oji), where there are markets and towns and all things as on this earth, and so the Tschwi would have little difficulty in replacing human beings at funerals with gold-dust, cloth, and other forms of riches, and this is already done in districts under white influence.  But in the Delta there is no under-world to live in, the souls shortly after reaching the under-world being forwarded back to this, in new babies, and the wealth that is sent down with a man serves as an indication as to what class of baby the soul is to be repacked and sent up in.  As wealth in the Delta consists of women and slaves I do not believe the under-world gods of the Niger would understand the status of a chief who arrived before them, let us say, with ten puncheons of palm oil, and four hundred yards of crimson figured velvet; they would say, “Oh! very good as far as it goes, but where is your real estate?  The chances are you are only a trade slave boy and have stolen these things”; and in consequence of this, killing at funerals will be a custom exceedingly difficult to stamp out in these regions.  Try and imagine yourself how abhorrent it must be to send down a dear and honoured relative to the danger of his being returned to this world shortly as a slave.  There is no doubt a certain idea among the Negroes that some souls may get a rise in status on their next incarnation.  You often hear a woman saying she will be a man next time, a slave he will be a freeman, and so on, but how or why some souls obtain promotion I have not yet sufficient evidence to show.  I think a little more investigation will place this important point in my possession.  I once said to a Calabar man, “But surely it would be easy for a man’s friends to cheat; they could send down a chief’s outfit with a man, though he was only a small man here?”</p>
<p>“No,” said he, “the other souls would tell on him, and then he would get sent up as a dog or some beast as a punishment.”</p>
<p>My first conception of the prevalence of the incarnation idea was also gained from a Delta negro.  I said, “Why in the world do you throw away in the bush the bodies of your dead slaves?  Where I have been they tie a string to the leg of a dead slave and when they bury him bring the string to the top and fix it to a peg, with the owner’s name on, and then when the owner dies he has that slave again down below.”</p>
<p>“They be fool men,” said he, and he went on to explain that the ghost of that slave would be almost immediately back on earth again growing up ready to work for some one else, and would not wait for its last owner’s soul down below, and out of the luxuriant jungle of information that followed I gathered that no man’s soul dallies below long, and also that a soul returning to a family, a thing ensured by certain ju-jus, was identified.  The new babies as they arrive in the family are shown a selection of small articles belonging to deceased members whose souls are still absent; the thing the child catches hold of identifies him.  “Why he’s Uncle John, see! he knows his own pipe;” or “That’s cousin Emma, see! she knows her market calabash,” and so on.</p>
<p>I remember discoursing with a very charming French official on the difficulty of eradicating fetish customs.</p>
<p>“Why not take the native in the rear, Mademoiselle,” said he, “and convert the native gods?”</p>
<p>I explained that his ingenious plan was not feasible, because you cannot convert gods.  Even educating gods is hopeless work.  All races of men through countless ages, have been attempting to make their peculiar deities understand how they are wanted to work, and what they are wanted to do, and the result is anything but encouraging.</p>
<p>As I have dwelt on the repellent view of Negro funeral custom, I must in justice to them cite their better view.  There is a custom that I missed much on going south of Calabar, for it is a pretty one.  Outside the villages in the Calabar districts, by the sides of the most frequented roads, you will see erections of boughs.  I do not think these are intended for huts, but for beds, for they are very like the Calabar type of bed, only made in wood instead of clay.  Over them a roof of mats is put, to furnish a protection against rain.</p>
<p>These shelters - graves or fetish huts they are wrongly called by Europeans - are made by driving four longish stout poles into the ground while at the height of about three feet or so four more poles are tied so as to make a skeleton platform which is filled in with withies and made flat.  Another set of five poles is tied above, and to these the roof is affixed.  On the platform, is placed the bedding belonging to the deceased, the undercloth, counterpane, etc., and at the head are laid the pillows, bolster-shaped and stuffed with cotton-tree fluff, or shredded palm-leaves, and covered with some gaily-coloured cotton cloth.  In every case I have seen - and they amount to hundreds, for you cannot take an hour’s walk even from Duke Town without coming upon a dozen or so of these erections - the pillows are placed so that the person lying on the bed would look towards the village.</p>
<p>On the roof and on the bed, and underneath it on the ground, are placed the household utensils that belonged to the deceased; the calabashes, the basins, the spoons cut out of wood, and the boughten iron ones, as we should say in Devon, and on the stakes are hung the other little possessions; there is one I know of made for the ghost of a poor girl who died, on to the stakes of which are hung the dolls and the little pincushions, etc., given her by a kind missionary.</p>
<p>Food is set out at these places and spirit poured over them from time to time, and sometimes, though not often, pieces of new cloth are laid on them.  Most of the things are deliberately damaged before they are put on the home for the spirit; I do not think this is to prevent them from being stolen, because all are not damaged sufficiently to make them useless.  There was a beautifully made spoon with a burnt-in pattern on one of these places when I left Calabar to go South, and on my return, some six months after, it was still there.  On another there was a very handsome pair of market calabashes, also much decorated, that were only just chipped and in better repair than many in use in Calabar markets, and I make no doubt the spoon and they are still lying rotting among the <i>débris</i> of the pillows, etc.  These places are only attended to during the time the spirit is awaiting burial, as they are regarded merely as a resting-place for it while it is awaiting this ceremony.  The body is not buried near them, I may remark.</p>
<p>In spite, however, of the care that is taken to bury spirits, a considerable percentage from various causes - poverty of the relations, the deceased being a stranger in the land, accidental death in some unknown part of the forest or the surf - remain unburied, and hang about to the common danger of the village they may choose to haunt.  Many devices are resorted to, to purify the villages from these spirits.  One which was in use in Creek Town, Calabar, to within a few years ago, and which I am informed is still customary in some interior villages, was very ingenious, and believed to work well by those who employed it.</p>
<p>In the houses were set up Nbakim, - large, grotesque images carved of wood and hung about with cloth strips and gew-gaws.  Every November in Creek Town (I was told by some authorities it was every second November) there was a sort of festival held.  Offerings of food and spirits were placed before these images; a band of people accompanied by the rest of the population used to make a thorough round of the town, up and down each street and round every house, dancing, singing, screaming and tom-toming, in fact making all the noise they knew how to - and a Calabar Effik is very gifted in the power of making noise.  After this had been done for what was regarded as a sufficient time, the images were taken out of the houses, the crowd still making a terrific row and were then thrown into the river, and the town was regarded as being cleared of spirits.</p>
<p>The rationale of the affair is this.  The wandering spirits are attracted by the images, and take shelter among their rags, like earwigs or something of that kind.  The <i>charivari</i> is to drive any of the spirits who might be away from their shelters back into them.  The shouting of the mob is to keep the spirits from venturing out again while they are being carried to the river.  The throwing of the images, rags and all, into the river, is to destroy the spirits or at least send them elsewhere.  They did not go and pour boiling water on their earwig-traps, as wicked white men do, but they meant the same thing, and when this was over they made and set up new images for fresh spirits who might come into the town, and these were kept and tended as before, until the next N’dok ceremony came round.</p>
<p>It is owing to the spiritual view which the African takes of existence at large that ceremonial observances form the greater part of even his common-law procedure.</p>
<p>There is, both among the Negro and Bantu, a recognised code of law, founded on principles of true but merciless justice.  It is not often employed, because of the difficulty and the danger to the individual who appeals to it, should that individual be unbacked by power, but nevertheless the code exists.</p>
<p>The African is particularly hard on theft; he by no means “compounds for sins he is inclined to by damning those he has no mind to,” for theft is a thing he revels in.</p>
<p>Persons are tried for theft on circumstantial evidence, direct testimony, and ordeal.  Laws relating to mortgage are practically the same among Negroes and Bantu and Europeans.  Torts are not recognised; unless the following case from Cameroon points to a vague realisation of them.  A. let his canoe out to B., in good order, so that B. could go up river, and fetch down some trade.  B. did not go himself, but let C., who was not his slave, but another free man who also wanted to go up for trade, have the canoe on the understanding that in payment for the loan of the said canoe C. should bring down B’s. trade.</p>
<p>A. was not told about this arrangement at all.  B. says A. was, only A. was so blind drunk at the time he did not understand.  Well, up river C. goes in the canoe, and fetches up on a floating stump in the river, and staves a hole you could put your head in, in the bow of the said canoe.  C. returns it to B. in this condition.  B. returns it to A. in this condition.  A. sues B. before native chief, saying he lent his canoe to B. on the understanding, always implied in African loans, that it was to be returned in the same state as when lent, fair wear and tear alone excepted.  B. tries first to get C. to pay for the canoe, and for the rent of the canoe on top, as a compensation for the delay in bringing down his, B’s., trade.  C. calls B. the illegitimate offspring of a greenhouse-lizard, and pleads further that the floating log was a <i>force majeure</i> - an act of God, and denies liability on all counts.  B. then pleads this as his own defence in the case of A. and B. (authorities cited in support of this view); he also pleads he is not liable, because C. is a free man, and not his slave.</p>
<p>The case went on for a week; the judge was drunk for five days in his attempt to get his head clear.  The decision finally was that B. was to pay A. full compensation.  B. v. C. is still pending.</p>
<p>The laws against adultery are, theoretically, exceedingly severe.  The punishment is death, and this is sometimes carried out.  The other day King Bell in Cameroon flogged one of his wives to death, and the German Government have deposed and deported him, for you cannot do that sort of thing with impunity within a stone’s throw of a Government head-quarters.  But as a general rule all along the Coast the death penalty for murder or adultery is commuted to a fine, or you can send a substitute to be killed for you, if you are rich.  This is frequently done, because it is cheaper, if you have a seedy slave, to give him to be killed in your stead than to pay a fine which is often enormous.</p>
<p>The adultery itself is often only a matter of laying your hand, even in self-defence from a virago, on a woman - or brushing against her in the path.  These accusations of adultery are, next to witchcraft, the great social danger to the West Coast native, and they are often made merely from motives of extortion or spite, and without an atom of truth in them.</p>
<p>It is customary for a chief to put his wives frequently to ordeal on this point, and this is almost always done after there has been a big devil-making, or a dance, which his family have been gracing with their presence.  The usual method of applying the ordeal is by boiling palm-oil - a pot is nearly filled with the oil, which is brought to the boil over a fire; when it is seething, the woman to be tried is brought out in front of it.  She first dips her hands into water, and then has administered to her the M’biam oath saying or having said for her that long elaborate formula, in a form adjusted to meet the case.  Then she plunges her hand into the boiling oil for an instant, and shakes the oil off with all possible rapidity, and the next woman comes forward and goes through the same performance, and so on.  Next day, the hands of the women are examined, and those found blistered are adjudged guilty, and punished.  In order to escape heavy punishment the woman will accuse some man of having hustled against her, or sat down on a bench beside her, and so on, and the accused man has to pay up.  If he does not, in the Calabar district, Egbo will come and “eat the adultery,” and there won’t be much of that man’s earthly goods left.  Sometimes the accusation is volunteered by the woman, and frequently the husband and wife conspire together and cook up a case against a man for the sake of getting the damages.  There is nothing that ensures a man an unblemished character in West Africa, save the possession of sufficient power to make it risky work for people to cast slurs on it.</p>
<p>The ownership of children is a great source of palaver.  The law among Negroes and Bantus is that the children of a free woman belong to her.  In the case of tribes believing in the high importance of uncles considerable powers are vested in that relative, while in other tribes certain powers are vested in the father.</p>
<p>The children of slave wives are the only children the father has absolute power over if he is the legal owner of the slave woman.  If, as is frequently the case, a free man marries a slave woman who belongs to another man, all her children are the absolute property of her owner, not her husband; and the owner of the woman can take them and sell them, or do whatsoever he chooses with them, unless the free man father redeems them, as he usually does, although the woman may still remain the absolute property of the owner, recallable by him at any time.</p>
<p>This law is the cause of the most brain-spraining palavers that come before the white authorities.  There is naturally no statute of limitations in West Africa, because the African does not care a row of pins about time.  The wily A. will let his slave woman live with B. without claiming the redemption fees as they become due - letting them stand over, as it were, at compound interest.  All the male as well as the female children of the first generation are A.’s property, and all the female children of these children are his property even unto the second and third generation and away into eternity.  A. may die before he puts in his claim, in which case the ownership passes on into the hands of his heir or assignees, who may foreclose at once, on entering into their heritage, or may again let things accumulate for their heirs.  Anyhow, sooner or later the foreclosure comes and then there is trouble.  X., Y., Z., etc., free men, have married some of the original A.’s slave woman’s descendants.  They have either bought them right out, or kept on conscientiously redeeming children of theirs as they arrived.  Of course A., or his heirs, contend that X., Y., Z., etc. have been wasting time and money by so doing, because the people X., Y., Z. have paid the money to had no legal title to the women.  Of course X., Y., Z. contend that their particular woman, or her ancestress, was duly redeemed from the legal owner.</p>
<p>Remember there is no documentary evidence available, and squads of equally reliable and oldest inhabitants are swearing hard - all both ways.  Just realise this, and that your Government says that whenever native law is not blood-stained it must be supported, and you may be able to realise the giddy mazes of a native palaver, which if you conscientiously attempt to follow with the determination that justice shall be duly administered, will for certain lay you low with an attack of fever.</p>
<p>The law of ownership is not all in favour of the owner, masters being responsible for damage done by their slaves, and this law falls very heavily and expensively on the owner of a bad slave.  Indeed, when one lives out here and sees the surrounding conditions of this state of culture, the conviction grows on you that, morally speaking, the African is far from being the brutal fiend he is often painted, a creature that loves cruelty and blood for their own sake.  The African does not; and though his culture does not contain our institutions, lunatic asylums, prisons, workhouses, hospitals, etc., he has to deal with the same classes of people who require these things.  So with them he deals by means of his equivalent institutions, slavery, the lash, and death.  You have just as much right, my logical friend, to call the West Coast Chief hard names for his habit of using brass bars, heads of tobacco, and so on, in place of sixpenny pieces, as you have to abuse him for clubbing an inveterate thief.  It’s deplorably low of him, I own, but by what alternative plan of government his can be replaced I do not quite see, under existing conditions.  In religious affairs, the affairs which lead him into the majority of his iniquities, his real sin consists in believing too much.  In his witchcraft, the sin is the same.  Toleration means indifference, I believe, among all men.  The African is not indifferent on the subject of witchcraft, and I do not see how one can expect him to be.  Put yourself in his place and imagine you have got hold of a man or woman who has been placing a live crocodile or a catawumpus of some kind into your own or a valued relative’s, or fellow-townsman’s inside, so that it may eat up valuable viscera, and cause you or your friend suffering and death.  How would you feel?  A little like lynching your captive, I fancy.</p>
<p>I confess that the more I know of the West Coast Africans the more I like them.  I own I think them fools of the first water for their power of believing in things; but I fancy I have analogous feelings towards even my fellow-countrymen when they go and violently believe in something that I cannot quite swallow.</p>

<br/></div>
<p class="c1">In which the Voyager complains of the inconveniences arising from the method of African thought, and discourses on apparitions and Deities.</p>
<p>However much some of the African’s mental attributes get under-rated, I am sure there are others of them for which he gets more credit than he deserves.  One of these is his imagination.  It strikes the new-comer with awe, and frequently fills him with rage, when he first meets it; but as he matures and gets used to the African, he sees the string.  For the African fancy is not the “aërial fancy flying free,” mentioned by our poets, but merely the aërial of the theatre suspended by a wire or cord.  The wire that supports the African’s fancy may be a very thin, small fact indeed, or in some cases merely his incapacity to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, which give rise to his idea that everything is possessed of a soul.  Everything has a soul to him, and to make confusion worse confounded, he usually believes in the existence of matter apart from its soul.  But there is little he won’t believe in, if it comes to that; and I have a feeling of thankfulness that Buddhism, Theosophy, and above all Atheism, which chases its tail and proves that nothing can be proved, have not yet been given the African to believe in.</p>
<p>The African’s want of making it clear in his language whether he is referring to an animate or inanimate thing, has landed me in many a dilemma, and his foolishness in not having a male and female gender in his languages amounts to a nuisance.  For example, I am a most ladylike old person and yet get constantly called “Sir.”  The other day, circumstances having got beyond my control during the afternoon, I arrived in the evening in a saturated condition at a white settlement, and wishing to get accommodation for myself and my men, I made my way to the factory of a firm from whose representatives I have always received great and most courteous help.  The agent in charge was not at home, and his steward-boy said, “Massa live for Mr. B.’s house.”  “Go tell him I live for come from,” etc., said I, and “I fit for want place for my men.”  I had nothing to write on, or with, and I thought the steward-boy could carry this little message to its destination without dropping any of it, as Mr. B.’s house was close by; but I was wrong.  Off he went, and soon returned with the note I here give a copy of: -</p>
<p>“DEAR OLD MAN,<br/>
     “You must be in a deuce of a mess after the tornado.  Just help yourself to a set of my dry things.  The shirts are in the bottom drawer, the trousers are in the box under the bed, and then come over here to the sing-song.  My leg is dickey or I’d come across. - Yours,” etc.</p>
<p>Had there been any smelling salts or sal volatile in this subdivision of the Ethiopian region, I should have forthwith fainted on reading this, but I well knew there was not, so I blushed until the steam from my soaking clothes (for I truly was “in a deuce of a mess”) went up in a cloud and then, just as I was, I went “across” and appeared before the author of that awful note.  When he came round, he said it had taken seven years’ growth out of him, and was intensely apologetic.  I remarked it had very nearly taken thirty years’ growth out of me, and he said the steward-boy had merely informed him that “White man live for come from X,” a place where he knew there was another factory belonging to his firm, and he naturally thought it was the agent from X who had come across.</p>
<p>You rarely, indeed I believe never, find an African with a gift for picturesque descriptions of scenery.  The nearest approach to it I ever got was from my cook when we were on Mungo mah Lobeh.  He proudly boasted he had been on a mountain, up Cameroon River, with a German officer, and on that mountain, “If you fall down one side you die, if you fall down other side you die.”</p>
<p>Graphic and vivid descriptions of incidents you often get, but it is not Art.  The effect is produced entirely by a bald brutality of statement, the African having no artistic reticence whatsoever.  One fine touch, however, which does not come in under this class was told me by my lamented friend Mr. Harris of Calabar.  Some years ago he had out a consignment of Dutch clocks with hanging weights, as is natural to the Dutch clock.  They were immensely popular among the chiefs, and were soon disposed of save one, which had seen trouble on the voyage out and lost one of its weights.  Mr. Harris, who was a man of great energy and resource, melted up some metal spoons and made a new weight and hung it on the clock.  The day he finished this a chief came in, anxious for a Dutch clock, and Mr. Harris forthwith sold him the repaired one.  About a week elapsed, and then the chief turned up at the factory again with a rueful countenance, followed by a boy carrying something swathed in a cloth.  It was the clock.</p>
<p>“You do me bad too much, Mr. Harris,” said the chief.  Mr. Harris denied this on the spot with the vehemence of injured innocence.  The chief shook his head and spat profusely and sorrowfully.</p>
<p>“You no sabe him clock you done sell me?” said he.  “When I look him clock it no be to-day, it be to morrow.”  Mr. Harris took the clock back, to see what was the cause of this strange state of affairs.  Of course it arose from his having been too liberal in the amount of spoon in the weight, and this being altered, the chief was not hurried onward to his grave at such a rattling pace; “but,” said Mr. Harris, “that clock was a flyer to the last.”</p>
<p>But I will not go into the subject of African languages here, but only remark of them that although they are elaborate enough to produce, for their users, nearly every shade of erroneous statement, they are not, save perhaps M’pongwe, elaborate enough to enable a native to state his exact thought.  Some of them are very dependent on gesture.  When I was with the Fans they frequently said, “We will go to the fire so that we can see what they say,” when any question had to be decided after dark, and the inhabitants of Fernando Po, the Bubis, are quite unable to converse with each other unless they have sufficient light to see the accompanying gestures of the conversation.  In all cases I feel sure the African’s intelligence is far ahead of his language.</p>
<p>The African is usually great at dreams, and has them very noisily; but he does not seem to me to attach immense importance to them, certainly not so much as the Red Indian does.  I doubt whether there is much real ground for supposing that from dreams came man’s first conception of the spirit world, and I think the origin of man’s religious belief lies in man’s misfortunes.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the very earliest human beings found, as their descendants still find, their plans frustrated, let them plan ever so wisely and carefully; they must have seen their companions overtaken by death and disaster, arising both from things they could see and from things they could not see.  The distinction between these two classes of phenomena is not so definitely recognised by savages or animals as it is by the more cultured races of humanity.  I doubt whether a savage depends on his five senses alone to teach him what the world is made of, any more than a Fellow of the Royal Society does.  From this method of viewing nature I feel sure that the general idea arose - which you find in all early cultures - that death was always the consequence of the action of some malignant spirit, and that there is no accidental or natural death, as we call it; and death is, after all, the most impressive attribute of life.</p>
<p>If a man were knocked on the head with a club, or shot with an arrow, the cause of death is clearly the malignancy of the person using these weapons; and so it is easy to think that a man killed by a fallen tree, or by the upsetting of a canoe in the surf, or in an eddy in the river, is also the victim of some being using these things as weapons.</p>
<p>A man having thus gained a belief that there are more than human actors in life’s tragedy, the idea that disease is also a manifestation of some invisible being’s wrath and power seems to me natural and easy; and he knows you can get another man for a consideration to kill or harm a third party, and so he thinks that, for a consideration, you can also get one of these superhuman beings, which we call gods or devils, but which the African regards in another light, to do so.</p>
<p>A certain set of men and women then specialise off to study how these spirits can be managed, and so arises a priesthood; and the priests, or medicine men as they are called in their earliest forms, gradually, for their own ends, elaborate and wrap round their profession with ritual and mystery.</p>
<p>The savage is also conscious of another great set of phenomena which, he soon learns, take no interest in human affairs.  The sun which rises and sets, the moon which changes, the tides which come and go: - what do they care?  Nothing; and what is more, sacrifice to them what you may, you cannot get them to care about you and your affairs, and so the savage turns his attention to those other spirits that do take only too much interest, as is proved by those unexpected catastrophes; and, as their actions show, these spirits are all malignant, so he deals with them just as he would deal with a bad man whom he was desirous of managing.  He flatters and fees them, he deprives himself of riches to give to them as sacrifices, believing they will relish it all the more because it gives him pain of some sort to give it to them.  He holds that they think it will be advisable for them to encourage him to continue the giving by occasionally doing what he asks them.  Naturally he never feels sure of them; he sees that you may sacrifice to a god for years, you may wrap him up - or more properly speaking, the object in which he resides - in your only cloth on chilly nights while you shiver yourself; you and your children, and your mother, and your sister and her children, may go hungry that food may rot upon his shrine; and yet, in some hour of dire necessity, the power will not come and save you - because he has been lured away by some richer gifts than yours.</p>
<p>You white men will say, “Why go on believing in him then?” but that is an idea that does not enter the African mind.  I might just as well say “Why do you go on believing in the existence of hansom cabs,” because one hansom cab driver malignantly fails to take you where you want to go, or fails to arrive in time to catch a train you wished to catch.</p>
<p>The African fully knows the liability of his fetish to fail, but he equally fully knows its power.  One, to me, grandly tragic instance of this I learnt at Opobo.  There was a very great Fetish doctor there, universally admired and trusted, who lived out on the land at the mouth of the Great River.  One day he himself fell sick, and he made ju-ju against the sickness; but it held on, and he grew worse.  He made more ju-ju of greater power, but again in vain, and then he made the greatest ju-ju man can make, and it availed nought, and he knew he was dying; and so, with his remaining strength, he broke up and dishonoured and destroyed all the Fetishes in which the spirits lived, and cast them out into the surf and died like a man.</p>
<p>Then horror came upon the people when they knew he had done this, and they burnt his house and all things belonging to him, and cried upon the spirits not to forsake them, not to lay this one man’s deadly sin at their doors.</p>
<p>In connection with the gods of West Africa I may remark that in almost all the series of native tradition there, you will find accounts of a time when there was direct intercourse between the gods or spirits that live in the sky, and men.  That intercourse is always said to have been cut off by some human error; for example, the Fernando Po people say that once upon a time there was no trouble or serious disturbance upon earth because there was a ladder, made like the one you get palm-nuts with, “only long, long;” and this ladder reached from earth to heaven so the gods could go up and down it and attend personally to mundane affairs.  But one day a cripple boy started to go up the ladder, and he had got a long way up when his mother saw him, and went up in pursuit.  The gods, horrified at the prospect of having boys and women invading heaven, threw down the ladder, and have since left humanity severely alone.  The Timneh people, north-east of Sierra Leone, say that in old times God was very friendly with men, and when He thought a man had lived long enough on earth, He sent a messenger to him telling him to come up into the sky, and stay with Him; but once there was a man who, when the messenger of God came, did not want to leave his wives, his slaves, and his riches, and so the messenger had to go back without him; and God was very cross and sent another messenger for him, who was called Disease, but the man would not come for him either, and so Disease sent back word to God that he must have help to bring the man; and so God sent another messenger whose name was Death; and Disease and Death together got hold of the man, and took him to God; and God said in future He would always send these messengers to fetch men.</p>
<p>The Fernando Po legend may be taken as fairly pure African, but the Timneh, I expect, is a transmogrified Arabic story - though I do not know of anything like it among Arabic stories; but they are infinite in quantity, and there is a certain ring about it I recognise, and these Timnehs are much in contact with the Mohammedan, Mandingoes, etc.  In none of the African stories is there given anything like the importance to dreams that there is given to attempts to account for accidents and death; and surely it must have been more impressive and important to a man to have got his leg or arm snapped off by a crocodile in the river, or by a shark in the surf, or to have got half killed, or have seen a friend killed by a falling tree in the forest in the day time, than to have experienced the most wonderful of dreams.  He sees that however terrific his dream-experiences may have been, he was not much the worse for them.  Not so in the other case, a limb gone or a life gone is more impressive, and more necessary to account for.</p>
<p>No trace of sun-worship have I ever found.  The firmament is, I believe, always the great indifferent and neglected god, the Nyan Kupon of the Tschwi, and the Anzambe, Nzam, etc., of the Bantu races.  The African thinks this god has great power if he would only exert it, and when things go very badly with him, when the river rises higher than usual and sweeps away his home and his plantations; when the smallpox stalks through the land, and day and night the corpses float down the river past him, and he finds them jammed among his canoes that are tied to the beach, and choking up his fish traps; and then when at last the death-wail over its victims goes up night and day from his own village, he will rise up and call upon this great god in a terror maddened by despair, that he may hear and restrain the evil workings of these lesser devils; but he evidently finds, as Peer Gynt says, “Nein, er hört nicht.  Er ist taub wie gewöhnlich” for there is no organised cult for Anzam.</p>
<p>Accounts of apparitions abound in all the West Coast districts, and although the African holds them all in high horror and terror, he does not see anything supernatural in his “Duppy.”  It is a horrid thing to happen on, but there is nothing strange about it, and he is ten thousand times more frightened than puzzled over the affair.  He does not want to “investigate” to see whether there is anything in it.  He wants to get clear away, and make ju-ju against it, “one time.”</p>
<p>These apparitions have a great variety of form, for, firstly, there are all the true spirits, nature spirits; secondly, the spirits of human beings - these human spirits are held to exist before as well as during and after bodily life; thirdly, the spirits of things.  Probably the most horrid of class one is the Tschwi’s Sasabonsum.  Whether Sasabonsum is an individual or a class is not quite clear, but I believe he is a class of spirits, each individual of which has the same characteristics, the same manner of showing anger, the same personal appearance, and the same kind of residence.  I am a devoted student of his cult and I am always coming across equivalent forms of him in other tribes as well as the Tschwi, and I think he is very early.  As the Tschwi have got their religious notions in a most tidy and definite state, we will take their version of Sasabonsum.</p>
<p>He lives in the forest, in or under those great silk-cotton trees around the roots of which the earth is red.  This coloured earth identifies a silk-cotton tree as being the residence of a Sasabonsum, as its colour is held to arise from the blood it whips off him as he goes down to his under-world home after a night’s carnage.  All silk-cotton trees are suspected because they are held to be the roosts for Duppies.  But the red earth ones are feared with a great fear, and no one makes a path by them, or a camp near them at night.</p>
<p>Sasabonsum is a friend of witches.  He is of enormous size, and of a red colour.  He wears his hair straight and he waylays unprotected wayfarers in the forest at night, and in all districts except that of Apollonia he eats them.  Round Apollonia he only sucks their blood.  Natives of this district after meeting him have crawled home and given an account of his appearance, and then expired.</p>
<p>Ellis says he is believed to be implacable, and when angered can never be mollified or propitiated, but it is certain that human victims are constantly sacrificed to him in districts beyond white control; in districts under it, the equivalent value of a human sacrifice in sheep and goats is offered to him.  In Ashantee he has priests, and of course human sacrifice.  Away among the Dahomeyan tribes - where he has kept his habits but got another name, and seems to have crystallised from a class into an individual - the usual way in which a god develops - he has priests and priestesses, and they are holy terrors; but among the Tschwi, Sasabonsum is mainly dealt with by witches, and people desirous of possessing the power of becoming witches.  They derive their power from him in a remarkable way.  I put myself to great personal inconvenience (fever risk, mosquito certainty, high leopard and snake palaver probability, and grave personal alarm and apprehension) to verify Colonel Ellis’s account of the methods witches employ in this case, to obtain ehsuhman and I find his account correct. <a id="citation363"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote363" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{363}</a></p>
<p>The chief use of a suhman is the power it gives its owner to procure the death of other people, not necessarily his own enemies, for he will sell charms made by the agency of his suhman to another person whose nerves have not been equal to facing Sasabonsum on his own account.  He can also provide by its agency other charms, such as those that protect houses from fire, and things and individuals from accidents on the road, or in canoes, and the home circle from good-looking but unprincipled young men, and so on.</p>
<p>As a rule the person who has a suhman keeps the fact pretty quiet, for the possession of such an article would lead half the catastrophes in his district, from the decease of pigs, fowls, and babies, to fires, etc., to be accredited to him, which would lead to his neighbours making “witch palaver” over him, and he would have to undergo poison-ordeal and other unpleasantness to clear his character.  He, however, always keeps a special day in his suhman’s honour, and should he be powerful, as a king or big chief, he will keep this day openly.  King Kwoffi Karri Kari, whom we fought with in 1874, used to make a big day for his suhman, which was kept in a box covered with gold plates, and he sacrificed a human victim to it every Tuesday, with general festivities and dances in its honour.</p>
<p>I should remark that Sasabonsum is married.  His wife, or more properly speaking his female form, is called Shamantin.  She is far less malignant than the male form.  Her name comes from Srahman - ghost or spirit; the termination “<i>tin</i>” is an abbreviation of <i>sintstin</i> - tall.  She is of immense height, and white; perhaps this idea is derived from the white stem of the silk-cotton trees wherein she invariably abides.  Her method of dealing with the solitary wayfarer is no doubt inconvenient to him, but it is kinder than her husband’s ways, for she does not kill and eat him, as Sasabonsum does, but merely detains him some months while she teaches him all about the forest: what herbs are good to eat, or to cure disease; where the game come to drink, and what they say to each other, and so forth.  I often wish I knew this lady, for the grim, grand African forests are like a great library, in which, so far, I can do little more than look at the pictures, although I am now busily learning the alphabet of their language, so that I may some day read what these pictures mean.</p>
<p>Do not go away with the idea, I beg, that goddesses as a general rule, are better than gods.  They are not.  There are stories about them which I could - I mean I could not - tell you.  There is one belonging also to the Tschwi.  She lives at Moree, a village five miles from Cape Coast.  She is, as is usual with deities, human in shape and colossal in size, and as is not usual with deities, she is covered with hair from head to foot, - short white hair like a goat.  Her abode is on the path to surf-cursed Anamabu near the sea-beach, and her name is Aynfwa; a worshipper of hers has only got to mention the name of a person he wishes dead when passing her abode and Aynfwa does the rest.  She is the goddess of all albinoes, who are said to be more frequent in occurrence round Moree than elsewhere.  Ellis says that in 1886, when he was there, they were 1 per cent. of the entire population.  These albinoes are, <i>ipso facto</i>, her priests and priestesses, and in old days an albino had only to name anywhere a person Aynfwa wished for, and that person was forthwith killed.</p>
<p>I think I may safely say that every dangerous place in West Africa is regarded as the residence of a god - rocks and whirlpools in the rivers - swamps “no man fit to pass” - and naturally, the surf.  Along the Gold Coast, at every place where you have to land through the surf, it fairly swarms with gods.  A little experience with the said surf inclines you to think, as the dabblers in spiritualism say “that there is something in it.”  I will back this West Coast surf - “the Calemma,” as we call it down South, against any other malevolent abomination, barring only the English climate.  Its ways of dealing with human beings are cunning and deceitful.  In its most ferocious moods it seizes a boat, straightway swamps it, and feeds its pet sharks with the boat’s occupants.  If the surf is merely sky-larking it lets your boat’s nose just smell the sand, and then says “Thought you were all right this time, did you though,” and drags the boat back again under the incoming wave, or catches it under the stern and gaily throws it upside down over you and yours on the beach.  Variety, they say, is charming.  Let those who say it, and those who believe it, just do a course of surf-work, and I’ll warrant they will change their minds.</p>
<p>There is one thing about the surf that I do not understand, and that is why witches always walk stark naked along the beach by it at night, and eat sea crabs the while.  That such is a confirmed habit of theirs is certain; and they tell me that while doing this the witches emit a bright light, and also that there is a certain medicine, which, if you have it with you, you can throw over the witch, and then he, or she, will remain blazing until morning time, running to and fro, crying out wildly, in front of the white, breaking, thundering surf wall, and when the dawn comes the fire burns the witch right up, leaving only a grey ash - and palaver set in this world and the next for that witch.</p>
<p>A highly-esteemed native minister told me when I was at Cape Coast last, that a fortnight before, he had been away in the Apollonia district on mission work.  One evening he and a friend were walking along the beach and the night was dark, so that you could see only the surf.  It is never too dark to see that, it seems to have light in itself.  They saw a flame coming towards them, and after a moment’s doubt they knew it was a witch, and feeling frightened, hid themselves among the bushes that edge the sandy shore.  As they watched, it came straight on and passed them, and they saw it disappear in the distance.  My informant laughed at himself, and very wisely said, “One has not got to believe those things here, one has in Apollonia.”</p>
<p>To the surf and its spirits the sea-board-dwelling Tschwis bring women who have had children and widows, both after a period of eight days from the birth of the child, or the death of the husband.</p>
<p>A widow remains in the house until this period has elapsed, neglecting her person, eating little food, and sitting on the bare floor in the attitude of mourning.  On the Gold Coast they bury very quickly, as they are always telling you, usually on the day after death, rarely later than the third day, even among the natives; and the spirit, or Srah, of the dead man is supposed to hang about his wives and his house until the ceremony of purification is carried out.  This is done, needless to say, with uproar.  The relations of each wife go to her house with musical instruments - I mean tom-toms and that sort of thing - and they take a quantity of mint, which grows wild in this country, with them.  This mint they burn, some of it in the house, the rest they place upon pans of live coals and carry round the widow as she goes in their midst down to the surf, her relatives singing aloud to the Srah of the departed husband, telling him that now he is dead and has done with the lady he must leave her.  This singing serves to warn all the women who are not relations to get out of the way, which of course they always carefully do, because if they were to see the widow their own husbands would die within the year.</p>
<p>When the party has arrived at the shore, they strip every rag off the widow, and throw it into the surf; and a thoughtful female relative having brought a suit of dark blue baft with her for the occasion, the widow is clothed in this and returns home, where a suitable festival is held, after which she may marry again; but if she were to marry before this ceremony, the Srah of the husband would play the mischief with husband number two or three, and so on, as the case might be.</p>
<p>In the inland Gold Coast districts the widows remain in a state of mourning for several months, and a selection of them, a quantity of slaves, and one or two free men are killed to escort the dead man to Srahmandazi; and as well as these, and in order to provide him with merchandise to keep up his house and state in the under-world, quantities of gold dust, rolls of rich velvets, silks, satins, etc., are thrown into the grave.</p>
<p>Among the dwellers in Cameroon, when you are across the Bantu border-line, velvets, etc., are buried with a big man or woman; but I am told it is only done for the glorification of his living relatives, so that the world may say, “So and so must be rich, look what a lot of trade he threw away at that funeral of his wife,” or his father, or his son, as the case may be; but I doubt whether this is the true explanation.  If it is, I should recommend my German friends, if they wish to intervene, to introduce the income tax into Cameroon - that would eliminate this custom.</p>
<p>The Tschwis hold that there is a definite earthly existence belonging to each soul of a human kind.  Let us say, for example, a soul has a thirty years’ bodily existence belonging to it.  Well, suppose that soul’s body gets killed off at twenty-five, its remaining five years it has to spend, if it is left alone, in knocking about its old haunts, homes, and wives.  In this state it is called a Sisa, and is a nuisance.  It will cause sickness.  It will throw stones.  It will pull off roofs, and it will play the very mischief with its wives’ subsequent husbands, all because, not having reached its full term of life, it has not learnt its way down the dark and difficult path to Srahmandazi, the entrance to which is across the Volta River to the N.E.  This knowledge of the path to Srahmandazi is a thing that grows gradually on a man’s immortal soul (the other three souls are not immortal), and naturally not having been allowed to complete his life, his knowledge is imperfect.  A man’s soul, however, can be taught the way, if necessary, in the funeral “custom” made by his relatives and the priests; but in a case of an incompletelifeonearthsoul, as a German would say, when it does arrive in the land of Insrah (pl.) it is in a weak and feeble state from the difficulties of its journey, whereas a soul that has lived out its allotted span of life goes straightway off to Srahmandazi as soon as its “custom” or “devil” is made and gives its surviving relatives no further trouble.  Still there is great difference of opinion among all the Tschwis and Ga men I have come across on this point, and Ellis likewise remarks on this difference of opinion.  Some informants say that a soul that has been sent hence before its time, although it is exhausted by the hardships it has suffered on its journey down, yet recovers health in a month or so; while a soul that has run its allotted span on earth is as feeble as a new-born babe on arriving in Srahmandazi, and takes years to pull round.  Other informants say they have no knowledge of these details, and state that all the difference they know of between the souls of men who have been killed and the men who have died, is that the former can always come back, and that really the safest way of disposing of this class of soul is, by suitable spells and incantations, to get it to enter into the body of a new-born baby, where it can live out the remainder of its life.</p>
<p>Before closing these observations on Srahmandazi I will give the best account of that land that I am at present able to.  Some day perhaps I may share the fate of the Oxford Professor in <i>In the Wrong Paradise</i> and go there myself, but so far my information is second-hand.</p>
<p>It is like this world.  There are towns and villages, rivers, mountains, bush, plantations, and markets.  When the sun rises here it sets in Srahmandazi.  It has its pleasures and its pains, not necessarily retributive or rewarding, but dim.  All souls in it grow forward or backward into the prime of life and remain there, some informants say; others say that each inhabitant remains there at the same age as he was when he quitted the world above.  This latter view is most like the South West one.  The former is possibly only an attempt to make Srahmandazi into a heaven in conformation with Christian teaching, which it is not, any more than it is a hell.</p>
<p>I have much curious information regarding its flora and fauna.  A great deal of both is seemingly indigenous, and then there are the souls of great human beings, the Asrahmanfw, and the souls of all the human beings, animals, and things sent down with them.  The ghosts do not seem to leave off their interest in mundane affairs, for they not only have local palavers, but try palavers left over from their earthly existence; and when there is an outbreak of sickness in a Fantee town or village, and several inhabitants die off, the opinion is often held that there is a big palaver going on down in Srahmandazi and that the spirits are sending up on earth for witnesses, subpœnaing them as it were.  Medicine men or priests are called in to find out what particular earthly grievance can be the subject of the ghost palaver, and when they have ascertained this, they take the evidence of every one in the town on this affair, as it were on commission, and transmit the information to the court sitting in Srahmandazi.  This prevents the living being incommoded by personal journeys down below, and although the priests have their fee, it is cheaper in the end, because the witnesses’ funeral expenses would fall heavier still.</p>
<p>Although far more elaborated and thought out than any other African underworld I have ever come across, the Tschwi Srahmandazi may be taken as a type of all the African underworlds.  The Bantu’s idea of a future life is a life spent in much such a place.  As far as I can make out there is no definite idea of eternity.  I have even come across cases in which doubt was thrown on the present existence of the Creating God, but I think this has arisen from attempts having been made to introduce concise conceptions into the African mind, conceptions that are quite foreign to its true nature and which alarm and worry it.  You never get the strange idea of the difference between time and eternity - the idea I mean, that they are different things - in the African that one frequently gets in cultured Europeans; and as for the human soul, the African always believes “that still the spirit is whole, and life and death but shadows of the soul.”</p>
