<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br/>
<br/></div>
<p class="c1">Setting forth how the Voyager is minded to ascend the mountain called Mungo Mah Lobeh, or the Throne of Thunder, and in due course reaches Buea, situate thereon.</p>
<p>After returning from Corisco I remained a few weeks in Gaboon, and then left on the <i>Niger</i>, commanded by Captain Davies.  My regrets, I should say, arose from leaving the charms and interests of Congo Français, and had nothing whatever to do with taking passage on one of the most comfortable ships of all those which call on the Coast.</p>
<p>The <i>Niger</i> was homeward-bound when I joined her, and in due course arrived in Cameroon River, and I was once again under the dominion of Germany.  It would be a very interesting thing to compare the various forms of European government in Africa - English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish; but to do so with any justice would occupy more space than I have at my disposal, for the subject is extremely intricate.  Each of these forms of government have their good points and their bad.  Each of them are dealing with bits of Africa differing from each other - in the nature of their inhabitants and their formation, and so on - so I will not enter into any comparison of them here.</p>
<p>From the deck of the <i>Niger</i> I found myself again confronted with my great temptation - the magnificent Mungo Mah Lobeh - the Throne of Thunder.  Now it is none of my business to go up mountains.  There’s next to no fish on them in West Africa, and precious little good rank fetish, as the population on them is sparse - the African, like myself, abhorring cool air.  Nevertheless, I feel quite sure that no white man has ever looked on the great Peak of Cameroon without a desire arising in his mind to ascend it and know in detail the highest point on the western side of the continent, and indeed one of the highest points in all Africa.</p>
<p>So great is the majesty and charm of this mountain that the temptation of it is as great to me to-day as it was on the first day I saw it, when I was feeling my way down the West Coast of Africa on the S.S. <i>Lagos</i> in 1893, and it revealed itself by good chance from its surf-washed plinth to its skyscraping summit.  Certainly it is most striking when you see it first, as I first saw it, after coasting for weeks along the low shores and mangrove-fringed rivers of the Niger Delta.  Suddenly, right up out of the sea, rises the great mountain to its 13,760 feet, while close at hand, to westward, towers the lovely island mass of Fernando Po to 10,190 feet.  But every time you pass it by its beauty grows on you with greater and greater force, though it is never twice the same.  Sometimes it is wreathed with indigo-black tornado clouds, sometimes crested with snow, sometimes softly gorgeous with gold, green, and rose-coloured vapours tinted by the setting sun, sometimes completely swathed in dense cloud so that you cannot see it at all; but when you once know it is there it is all the same, and you bow down and worship.</p>
<p>There are only two distinct peaks to this glorious thing that geologists brutally call the volcanic intrusive mass of the Cameroon Mountains, viz., Big Cameroon and Little Cameroon.  The latter, Mungo Mah Etindeh, has not yet been scaled, although it is only 5,820 feet.  One reason for this is doubtless that the few people in fever-stricken, over-worked West Africa who are able to go up mountains, naturally try for the adjacent Big Cameroon; the other reason is that Mungo Mah Etindeh, to which Burton refers as “the awful form of Little Cameroon,” is mostly sheer cliff, and is from foot to summit clothed in an almost impenetrable forest.  Behind these two mountains of volcanic origin, which cover an area on an isolated base of between 700 and 800 square miles in extent, there are distinctly visible from the coast two chains of mountains, or I should think one chain deflected, the so-called Rumby and Omon ranges.  These are no relations of Mungo, being of very different structure and conformation; the geological specimens I have brought from them and from the Cameroons being identified by geologists as respectively schistose grit and vesicular lava.</p>
<p>After spending a few pleasant days in Cameroon River in the society of Frau Plehn, my poor friend Mrs. Duggan having, I regret to say, departed for England on the death of her husband, I went round to Victoria, Ambas Bay, on the <i>Niger</i>, and in spite of being advised solemnly by Captain Davies to “chuck it as it was not a picnic,” I started to attempt the Peak of Cameroons as follows.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1895. - Left Victoria at 7.30, weather fine.  Herr von Lucke, though sadly convinced, by a series of experiments he has been carrying on ever since I landed, and I expect before, that you cannot be in three places at one time, is still trying to do so; or more properly speaking he starts an experiment series for four places, man-like, instead of getting ill as I should under the circumstances, and he kindly comes with me as far as the bridge across the lovely cascading Lukole River, and then goes back at about seven miles an hour to look after Victoria and his sick subordinates in detail.</p>
<p>I, with my crew, keep on up the grand new road the Government is making, which when finished is to go from Ambas Bay to Buea, 3,000 feet up on the mountain’s side.  This road is quite the most magnificent of roads, as regards breadth and general intention, that I have seen anywhere in West Africa, and it runs through a superbly beautiful country.  It is, I should say, as broad as Oxford Street; on either side of it are deep drains to carry off the surface waters, with banks of varied beautiful tropical shrubs and ferns, behind which rise, 100 to 200 feet high, walls of grand forest, the column-like tree-stems either hung with flowering, climbing plants and ferns, or showing soft red and soft grey shafts sixty to seventy feet high without an interrupting branch.  Behind this again rise the lovely foot hills of Mungo, high up against the sky, coloured the most perfect soft dark blue.</p>
<p>The whole scheme of colour is indescribably rich and full in tone.  The very earth is a velvety red brown, and the butterflies - which abound - show themselves off in the sunlight, in their canary-coloured, crimson, and peacock-blue liveries, to perfection.  After five minutes’ experience of the road I envy those butterflies.  I do not believe there is a more lovely road in this world, and besides, it’s a noble and enterprising thing of a Government to go and make it, considering the climate and the country; but to get any genuine pleasure out of it, it is requisite to hover in a bird- or butterfly-like way, for of all the truly awful things to walk on, that road, when I was on it, was the worst.</p>
<p>Of course this arose from its not being finished, not having its top on in fact: the bit that was finished, and had got its top on, for half a mile beyond the bridge, you could go over in a Bath chair.  The rest of it made you fit for one for the rest of your natural life, for it was one mass of broken lava rock, and here and there leviathan tree-stumps that had been partially blown up with gunpowder.</p>
<p>When we near the forest end of the road, it comes on to rain heavily, and I see a little house on the left-hand side, and a European engineer superintending a group of very cheerful natives felling timber.  He most kindly invites me to take shelter, saying it cannot rain as heavily as this for long.  My men also announce a desire for water, and so I sit down and chat with the engineer under the shelter of his verandah, while the men go to the water-hole, some twenty minutes off.</p>
<p>After learning much about the Congo Free State and other matters, I presently see one of my men sitting right in the middle of the road on a rock, totally unsheltered, and a feeling of shame comes over me in the face of this black man’s aquatic courage.  Into the rain I go, and off we start.  I conscientiously attempt to keep dry, by holding up an umbrella, knowing that though hopeless it is the proper thing to do.</p>
<p>We leave the road about fifty yards above the hut, turning into the unbroken forest on the right-hand side, and following a narrow, slippery, muddy, root-beset bush-path that was a comfort after the road.  Presently we come to a lovely mountain torrent flying down over red-brown rocks in white foam; exquisitely lovely, and only a shade damper than the rest of things.  Seeing this I solemnly fold up my umbrella and give it to Kefalla.  I then take charge of Fate and wade.</p>
<p>This particular stream, too, requires careful wading, the rocks over which it flows being arranged in picturesque, but perilous confusion; however all goes well, and getting to the other side I decide to “chuck it,” as Captain Davies would say, as to keeping dry, for the rain comes down heavier than ever.</p>
<p>Now we are evidently dealing with a foot-hillside, but the rain is too thick for one to see two yards in any direction, and we seem to be in a ghost-land forest, for the great palms and red-woods rise up in the mist before us, and fade out in the mist behind, as we pass on.  The rocks which edge and strew the path at our feet are covered with exquisite ferns and mosses - all the most delicate shades of green imaginable, and here and there of absolute gold colour, looking as if some ray of sunshine had lingered too long playing on the earth, and had got shut off from heaven by the mist, and so lay nestling among the rocks until it might rejoin the sun.</p>
<p>The path now becomes an absolute torrent, with mud-thickened water, which cascades round one’s ankles in a sportive way, and round one’s knees in the hollows in the path.  On we go, the path underneath the water seems a pretty equal mixture of rock and mud, but they are not evenly distributed.  Plantations full of weeds show up on either side of us, and we are evidently now on the top of a foot-hill.  I suspect a fine view of the sea could be obtained from here, if you have an atmosphere that is less than 99¾ per cent. of water.  As it is, a white sheet - or more properly speaking, considering its soft, stuffy woolliness, a white blanket - is stretched across the landscape to the south-west, where the sea would show.</p>
<p>We go down-hill now, the water rushing into the back of my shoes for a change.  The path is fringed by high, sugar-cane-like grass which hangs across it in a lackadaisical way, swishing you in the face and cutting like a knife whenever you catch its edge, and pouring continually insidious rills of water down one’s neck.  It does not matter.  The whole Atlantic could not get more water on to me than I have already got.  Ever and again I stop and wring out some of it from my skirts, for it is weighty.  One would not imagine that anything could come down in the way of water thicker than the rain, but it can.  When one is on the top of the hills, a cold breeze comes through the mist chilling one to the bone, and bending the heads of the palm trees, sends down from them water by the bucketful with a slap; hitting or missing you as the case may be.</p>
<p>Both myself and my men are by now getting anxious for our “chop,” and they tell me, “We look them big hut soon.”  Soon we do look them big hut, but with faces of undisguised horror, for the big hut consists of a few charred roof-mats, etc., lying on the ground.  There has been a fire in that simple savage home.  Our path here is cut by one that goes east and west, and after a consultation between my men and the Bakwiri, we take the path going east, down a steep slope between weedy plantations, and shortly on the left shows a steep little hill-side with a long low hut on the top.  We go up to it and I find it is the habitation of a Basel Mission black Bible-reader.  He comes out and speaks English well, and I tell him I want a house for myself and my men, and he says we had better come and stay in this one.  It is divided into two chambers, one in which the children who attend the mission-school stay, and wherein there is a fire, and one evidently the abode of the teacher.  I thank the Bible-reader and say that I will pay him for the house, and I and the men go in streaming, and my teeth chatter with cold as the breeze chills my saturated garment while I give out the rations of beef, rum, blankets, and tobacco to the men.  Then I clear my apartment out and attempt to get dry, operations which are interrupted by Kefalla coming for tobacco to buy firewood off the mission teacher to cook our food by.</p>
<p>Presently my excellent little cook brings in my food, and in with it come two mission teachers - our first acquaintance, the one with a white jacket, and another with a blue.  They lounge about and spit in all directions, and then chiefs commence to arrive with their families complete, and they sidle into the apartment and ostentatiously ogle the demijohn of rum.</p>
<p>They are, as usual, a nuisance, sitting about on everything.  No sooner have I taken an unclean-looking chief off the wood sofa, than I observe another one has silently seated himself in the middle of my open portmanteau.  Removing him and shutting it up, I see another one has settled on the men’s beef and rice sack.</p>
<p>It is now about three o’clock and I am still chilled to the bone in spite of tea.  The weather is as bad as ever.  The men say that the rest of the road to Buea is far worse than that which we have so far come along, and that we should never get there before dark, and “for sure” should not get there afterwards, because by the time the dark came down we should be in “bad place too much.”  Therefore, to their great relief, I say I will stay at this place - Buana - for the night, and go on in the morning time up to Buea; and just for the present I think I will wrap myself up in a blanket and try and get the chill out of me, so I give the chiefs a glass of rum each, plenty of head tobacco, and my best thanks for their kind call, and then turn them all out.  I have not been lying down five minutes on the plank that serves for a sofa by day and a bed by night, when Charles comes knocking at the door.  He wants tobacco.  “Missionary man no fit to let we have firewood unless we buy em.”  Give Charles a head and shut him out again, and drop off to sleep again for a quarter of an hour, then am aroused by some enterprising sightseers pushing open the window-shutters; when I look round there are a mass of black heads sticking through the window-hole.  I tell them respectfully that the circus is closed for repairs, and fasten up the shutters, but sleep is impossible, so I turn out and go and see what those men of mine are after.  They are comfortable enough round their fire, with their clothes suspended on strings in the smoke above them, and I envy them that fire.  I then stroll round to see if there is anything to be seen, but the scenery is much like that you would enjoy if you were inside a blanc-mange.  So as it is now growing dark I return to my room and light candles, and read Dr. Günther on Fishes.  Room becomes full of blacks.  Unless you watch the door, you do not see how it is done.  You look at a corner one minute and it is empty, and the next time you look that way it is full of rows of white teeth and watching eyes.  The two mission teachers come in and make a show of teaching a child to read the Bible.  After again clearing out the rank and fashion of Buana, I prepare to try and get a sleep; not an elaborate affair, I assure you, for I only want to wrap myself round in a blanket and lie on that plank, but the rain has got into the blankets and horror! there is no pillow.  The mission men have cleared their bed paraphernalia right out.  Now you can do without a good many things, but not without a pillow, so hunt round to find something to make one with; find the Bible in English, the Bible in German, and two hymn-books, and a candle-stick.  These seem all the small articles in the room - no, there is a parcel behind the books - mission teachers’ Sunday trousers - make delightful arrangement of books bound round with trousers and the whole affair wrapped in one of my towels.  Never saw till now advantage of Africans having trousers.  Civilisation has its points after all.  But it is no use trying to get any sleep until those men are quieter.  The partition which separates my apartment from theirs is a bamboo and mat affair, straight at the top so leaving under the roof a triangular space above common to both rooms.  Also common to both rooms are the smoke of the fire and the conversation.  Kefalla is holding forth in a dogmatic way, and some of the others are snoring.  There is a new idea in decoration along the separating wall.  Mr. Morris might have made something out of it for a dado.  It is composed of an arrangement in line of stretched out singlets.  Vaseline the revolver.  Wish those men would leave off chattering.  Kefalla seems to know the worst about most of the people, black and white, down in Ambas Bay, but I do not believe those last two stories.  Evidently great jokes in next room now; Kefalla has thrown himself, still talking, in the dark, on to the top of one of the mission teachers.  The women of the village outside have been keeping up, this hour and more, a most melancholy coo-ooing.  Those foolish creatures are evidently worrying about their husbands who have gone down to market in Ambas Bay, and who, they think, are lost in the bush.  I have not a shadow of a doubt that those husbands who are not home by now are safely drunk in town, or reposing on the grand new road the kindly Government have provided for them, either in one of the side drains, or tucked in among the lava rock.</p>
<p><i>September 21st</i>. - Coo-ooing went on all night.  I was aroused about 9.30 P.M., by uproar in adjacent hut: one husband had returned in a bellicose condition and whacked his wives, and their squarks and squalls, instead of acting as a warning to the other ladies, stimulate the silly things to go on coo-ooing louder and more entreatingly than ever, so that their husbands might come home and whack them too, I suppose, and whenever the unmitigated hardness of my plank rouses me I hear them still coo-ooing.</p>
<p>No watchman is required to wake you in the morning on the top of a Cameroon foot-hill by 5.30, because about 4 A.M. the dank chill that comes before the dawn does so most effectively.  One old chief turned up early out of the mist and dashed me a bottle of palm wine; he says he wants to dash me a fowl, but I decline, and accept two eggs, and give him four heads of tobacco.</p>
<p>The whole place is swathed in thick white mist through which my audience arrive.  But I am firm with them, and shut up the doors and windows and disregard their bangings on them while I am dressing, or rather re-dressing.  The mission teachers get in with my tea, and sit and smoke and spit while I have my breakfast.  Give me cannibal Fans!</p>
<p>It is pouring with rain again now, and we go down the steep hillock to the path we came along yesterday, keep it until we come to where the old path cuts it, and then turn up to the right following the old path’s course and leave Buana without a pang of regret.  Our road goes N.E.  Oh, the mud of it!  Not the clearish cascades of yesterday but sticky, slippery mud, intensely sticky, and intensely slippery.  The narrow path which is filled by this, is V-shaped underneath from wear, and I soon find the safest way is right through the deepest mud in the middle.</p>
<p>The white mist shuts off all details beyond ten yards in any direction.  All we can see, as we first turn up the path, is a patch of kokos of tremendous size on our right.  After this comes weedy plantation, and stretches of sword grass hanging across the road.  The country is even more unlevel than that we came over yesterday.  On we go, patiently doing our mud pulling through the valleys; toiling up a hillside among lumps of rock and stretches of forest, for we are now beyond Buana’s plantations; and skirting the summit of the hill only to descend into another valley.  Evidently this is a succession of foot-hills of the great mountain and we are not on its true face yet.  As we go on they become more and more abrupt in form, the valleys mere narrow ravines.  In the wet season (this is only the tornado season) each of these valleys is occupied by a raging torrent from the look of the confused water-worn boulders.  Now among the rocks there are only isolated pools, for the weather for a fortnight before I left Victoria had been fairly dry, and this rich porous soil soaks up an immense amount of water.  It strikes me as strange that when we are either going up or down the hills, the ground is less muddy than when we are skirting their summits, but it must be because on the inclines the rush of water clears the soil away down to the bed rock.  There is an outcrop of clay down by Buana, but though that was slippery, it is nothing to the slipperiness of this fine, soft, red-brown earth that is the soil higher up, and also round Ambas Bay.  This gets churned up into a sort of batter where there is enough water lying on it, and, when there is not, an ice slide is an infant to it.</p>
<p>My men and I flounder about; thrice one of them, load and all, goes down with a squidge and a crash into the side grass, and says “damn!” with quite the European accent; as a rule, however, we go on in single file, my shoes giving out a mellifluous squidge, and their naked feet a squish, squash.  The men take it very good temperedly, and sing in between accidents; I do not feel much like singing myself, particularly at one awful spot, which was the exception to the rule that ground at acute angles forms the best going.  This exception was a long slippery slide down into a ravine with a long, perfectly glassy slope up out of it.</p>
<p>After this we have a stretch of rocky forest, and pass by a widening in the path which I am told is a place where men blow, <i>i.e</i>. rest, and then pass through another a little further on, which is Buea’s bush market.  Then through an opening in the great war-hedge of Buea, a growing stockade some fifteen feet high, the lower part of it wattled.</p>
<p>At the sides of the path here grow banks of bergamot and balsam, returning good for evil and smiling sweetly as we crush them.  Thank goodness we are in forest now, and we seem to have done with the sword-grass.  The rocks are covered with moss and ferns, and the mist curling and wandering about among the stems is very lovely.</p>
<p>In our next ravine there is a succession of pools, part of a mountain torrent of greater magnitude evidently than those we have passed, and in these pools there are things swimming.  Spend more time catching them, with the assistance of Bum.  I do not value Kefalla’s advice, ample though it is, as being of any real value in the affair.  Bag some water-spiders and two small fish.  The heat is less oppressive than yesterday.  All yesterday one was being alternately smothered in the valley and chilled on the hill-tops.  To-day it is a more level temperature, about 70°, I fancy.</p>
<p>The soil up here, about 2,500 feet above sea-level, though rock-laden is exceedingly rich, and the higher we go there is more bergamot, native indigo, with its underleaf dark blue, and lovely coleuses with red markings on their upper leaves, and crimson linings.  I, as an ichthyologist, am in the wrong paradise.  What a region this would be for a botanist!</p>
<p>The country is gloriously lovely if one could only see it for the rain and mist; but one only gets dim hints of its beauty when some cold draughts of wind come down from the great mountains and seem to push open the mist-veil as with spirit hands, and then in a minute let it fall together again.  I do not expect to reach Buea within regulation time, but at 11.30 my men say “we close in,” and then, coming along a forested hill and down a ravine, we find ourselves facing a rushing river, wherein a squad of black soldiers are washing clothes, with the assistance of a squad of black ladies, with much uproar and sky-larking.  I too think it best to wash here, standing in the river and swishing the mud out of my skirts; and then wading across to the other bank, I wring out my skirts.  The ground on the further side of the river is cleared of bush, and only bears a heavy crop of balsam; a few steps onwards bring me in view of a corrugated iron-roofed, plank-sided house, in front of which, towards the great mountain which now towers up into the mist, is a low clearing with a quadrangle of native huts - the barracks.</p>
<p>I receive a most kindly welcome from a fair, grey-eyed German gentleman, only unfortunately I see my efforts to appear before him clean and tidy have been quite unavailing, for he views my appearance with unmixed horror, and suggests an instant hot bath.  I decline.  Men can be trying!  How in the world is any one going to take a bath in a house with no doors, and only very sketchy wooden window-shutters?</p>
<p>The German officer is building the house quickly, as Ollendorff would say, but he has not yet got to such luxuries as doors, and so uses army blankets strung across the doorway; and he has got up temporary wooden shutters to keep the worst of the rain out, and across his own room’s window he has a frame covered with greased paper.  Thank goodness he has made a table, and a bench, and a washhand-stand out of planks for his spare room, which he kindly places at my disposal; and the Fatherland has evidently stood him an iron bedstead and a mattress for it.  But the Fatherland is not spoiling or cosseting this man to an extent that will enervate him in the least.</p>
<p>The mist clears off in the evening about five, and the surrounding scenery is at last visible.  Fronting the house there is the cleared quadrangle, facing which on the other three sides are the lines of very dilapidated huts, and behind these the ground rises steeply, the great S.E. face of Mungo Mah Lobeh.  It looks awfully steep when you know you have got to go up it.  This station at Buea is 3,000 feet above sea-level, which explains the hills we have had to come up.  The mountain wall when viewed from Buea is very grand, although it lacks snowcap or glacier, and the highest summits of Mungo are not visible because we are too close under them, but its enormous bulk and its isolation make it highly impressive.  The forest runs up it in a great band above Buea, then sends up great tongues into the grass belt above.  But what may be above this grass belt I know not yet, for our view ends at the top of the wall of the great S.E. crater.  My men say there are devils and gold up beyond, but the German authorities do not support this view.  Those Germans are so sceptical.  This station is evidently on a ledge, for behind it the ground falls steeply, and you get an uninterrupted panoramic view of the Cameroon estuary and the great stretches of low swamp lands with the Mungo and the Bimbia rivers, and their many creeks and channels, and far away east the strange abrupt forms of the Rumby Mountains.  Herr Liebert says you can see Cameroon Government buildings from here, if only the day is clear, though they are some forty miles away.  This view of them is, save a missionary of the Basel mission, the only white society available at Buea.</p>
<p>I hear more details about the death of poor Freiherr von Gravenreuth, whose fine monument of a seated lion I saw in the Government House grounds in Cameroons the other day.  Bush fighting in these West African forests is dreadfully dangerous work.  Hemmed in by bush, in a narrow path along which you must pass slowly in single file, you are a target for all and any natives invisibly hidden in the undergrowth; and the war-hedge of Buea must have made an additional danger and difficulty here for the attacking party.  The lieutenant and his small band of black soldiers had, after a stiff fight, succeeded in forcing the entrance to this, when their ammunition gave out, and they had to fall back.  The Bueans, regarding this as their victory, rallied, and a chance shot killed the lieutenant instantly.  A further expedition was promptly sent up from Victoria and it wiped the error out of the Buean mind and several Bueans with it.  But it was a very necessary expedition.  These natives were a constant source of danger to the more peaceful trading tribes, whom they would not permit to traverse their territory.  The Bueans have been dealt with mercifully by the Germans, for their big villages, like Sapa, are still standing, and a continual stream of natives come into the barrack-yard, selling produce, or carrying it on down to Victoria markets, in a perfectly content and cheerful way.  I met this morning a big burly chief with his insignia of office - a great stick.  He, I am told, is the chief or Sapa whom Herr von Lucke has called to talk some palaver with down in Victoria.</p>
<p>At last I leave Herr Liebert, because everything I say to him causes him to hop, flying somewhere to show me something, and I am sure it is bad for his foot.  I go and see that my men are safely quartered.  Kefalla is laying down the law in a most didactic way to the soldiers.  Herr Liebert has christened him “the Professor,” and I adopt the name for him, but I fear “Windbag” would fit him better.</p>
<p>At 7.30 a heavy tornado comes rolling down upon us.  Masses of indigo cloud with livid lightning flashing in the van, roll out from over the wall of the great crater above; then with that malevolence peculiar to the tornado it sees all the soldiers and their wives and children sitting happily in the barrack yard, howling in a minor key and beating their beloved tom-toms, so it comes and sits flump down on them with deluges of water, and sends its lightning running over the ground in livid streams of living death.  Oh, they are nice things are tornadoes!  I wonder what they will be like when we are up in their home; up atop of that precious wall?  I had no idea Mungo was so steep.  If I had - well, I am in for it now!</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br/>
<br/></div>
<p class="c1">Wherein is recounted how the Voyager sets out from Buea, and goes up through the forest belt to the top of the S.E. crater of Mungo Mah Lobeh, with many dilemmas and disasters that befell on the way.</p>
<p><i>September 22nd</i>. - Wake at 5.  Fine morning.  Fine view towards Cameroon River.  The broad stretch of forest below, and the water-eaten mangrove swamps below that, are all a glorious indigo flushed with rose colour from “the death of the night,” as Kiva used to call the dawn.  No one stirring till six, when people come out of the huts, and stretch themselves and proceed to begin the day, in the African’s usual perfunctory, listless way.</p>
<p>My crew are worse than the rest.  I go and hunt cook out.  He props open one eye, with difficulty, and yawns a yawn that nearly cuts his head in two.  I wake him up with a shock, by saying I mean to go on up to-day, and want my chop, and to start one time.  He goes off and announces my horrible intention to the others.  Kefalla soon arrives upon the scene full of argument, “You no sabe this be Sunday, Ma?” says he in a tone that tells he considers this settles the matter.  I “sabe” unconcernedly; Kefalla scratches his head for other argument, but he has opened with his heavy artillery; which being repulsed throws his rear lines into confusion.  Bum, the head man, then turns up, sound asleep inside, but quite ready to come.  Bum, I find, is always ready to do what he is told, but has no more original ideas in his head than there are in a chair leg.  Kefalla, however, by scratching other parts of his anatomy diligently, has now another argument ready, the two Bakwiris are sick with abdominal trouble, that requires rum and rest, and one of the other boys has hot foot.</p>
<p>Herr Liebert now appears upon the scene, and says I can have some of his labourers, who are now more or less idle, because he cannot get about much with his bad foot to direct them, so I give the Bakwiris and the two hot foot cases “books” to take down to Herr von Lucke who will pay them off for me, and seeing that they have each a good day’s rations of rice, beef, etc., eliminate them from the party.</p>
<p>In addition to the labourers, I am to have as a guide Sasu, a black sergeant, who went up the Peak with the officers of the <i>Hyæna</i>, and I get my breakfast, and then hang about watching my men getting ready very slowly to start.  Off we get about 8, and start with all good wishes, and grim prophecies, from Herr Liebert.</p>
<p>Led by Sasu, and accompanied by “To-morrow,” a man who has come to Buea from some interior unknown district, and who speaks no known language, and whose business it is to help to cut a way through the bush, we go down the path we came and cross the river again.  This river seems to separate the final mass of the mountain from the foot-hills on this side.  Immediately after crossing it we turn up into the forest on the right hand side, and “To-morrow” cuts through an over-grown track for about half-an-hour, and then leaves us.</p>
<p>Everything is reeking wet, and we swish through thick undergrowth and then enter a darker forest where the earth is rocky and richly decorated with ferns and moss.  For the first time in my life I see tree-ferns growing wild in luxuriant profusion.  What glorious creations they are!  Then we get out into the middle of a koko plantation.  Next to sweet-potatoes, the premier abomination to walk through, give me kokos for good all-round tryingness, particularly when they are wet, as is very much the case now.  Getting through these we meet the war hedge again, and after a conscientious struggle with various forms of vegetation in a muddled, tangled state, Sasu says, “No good, path done got stopped up,” so we turn and retrace our steps all the way, cross the river, and horrify Herr Liebert by invading his house again.  We explain the situation.  Grave headshaking between him and Sasu about the practicability of any other route, because there is no other path.  I do not like to say “so much the better,” because it would have sounded ungrateful, but I knew from my Ogowé experiences that a forest that looks from afar a dense black mat is all right underneath, and there is a short path recently cut by Herr Liebert that goes straight up towards the forest above us.  It had been made to go to a clearing, where ambitious agricultural operations were being inaugurated, when Herr Liebert hurt his foot.  Up this we go, it is semi-vertical while it lasts, and it ends in a scrubby patch that is to be a plantation; this crossed we are in the <i>Urwald</i>, and it is more exquisite than words can describe, but not good going, particularly at one spot where a gigantic tree has fallen down across a little rocky ravine, and has to be crawled under.  It occurs to me that this is a highly likely place for snakes and an absolutely sure find for scorpions, and when we have passed it three of these latter interesting creatures are observed on the load of blankets which is fastened on to the back of Kefalla.  We inform Kefalla of the fact on the spot.  A volcanic eruption of entreaty, advice, and admonition results, but we still hesitate.  However, the gallant cook tackles them in a sort of tip-cat way with a stick, and we proceed into a patch of long grass, beyond which there is a reach of amomums.  The winged amomum I see here in Africa for the first time.  Horrid slippery things amomum sticks to walk on, when they are lying on the ground; and there is a lot of my old enemy the calamus about.</p>
<p>On each side are deep forested dells and ravines, and rocks show up through the ground in every direction, and things in general are slippery, and I wonder now and again, as I assume with unnecessary violence a recumbent position, why I came to Africa; but patches of satin-leaved begonias and clumps of lovely tree-ferns reconcile me to my lot.  Cook does not feel these forest charms, and gives me notice after an hour’s experience of mountain forest-belt work; what cook would not?</p>
<p>As we get higher we have to edge and squeeze every few minutes through the aërial roots of some tremendous kind of tree, plentiful hereabouts.  One of them we passed through I am sure would have run any Indian banyan hard for extent of ground covered, if it were measured.  In the region where these trees are frequent, the undergrowth is less dense than it is lower down.</p>
<p>Imagine a vast, seemingly limitless cathedral with its countless columns covered, nay, composed of the most exquisite dark-green, large-fronded moss, with here and there a delicate fern embedded in it as an extra decoration.  The white, gauze-like mist comes down from the upper mountain towards us: creeping, twining round, and streaming through the moss-covered tree columns - long bands of it reaching along sinuous, but evenly, for fifty and sixty feet or more, and then ending in a puff like the smoke of a gun.  Soon, however, all the mist-streams coalesce and make the atmosphere all their own, wrapping us round in a clammy, chill embrace; it is not that wool-blanket, smothering affair that we were wrapped in down by Buana, but exquisitely delicate.  The difference it makes to the beauty of the forest is just the same difference you would get if you put a delicate veil over a pretty woman’s face or a sack over her head.  In fact, the mist here was exceedingly becoming to the forest’s beauty.  Now and again growls of thunder roll out from, and quiver in the earth beneath our feet.  Mungo is making a big tornado, and is stirring and simmering it softly so as to make it strong.  I only hope he will not overdo it, as he does six times in seven, and make it too heavy to get out on to the Atlantic, where all tornadoes ought to go.  If he does the thing will go and burst on us in this forest to-night.</p>
<p>The forest now grows less luxuriant though still close - we have left the begonias and the tree-ferns, and are in another zone.  The trees now, instead of being clothed in rich, dark-green moss, are heavily festooned with long, greenish-white lichen.  It pours with rain.</p>
<p>At last we reach the place where the sergeant says we ought to camp for the night.  I have been feeling the time for camping was very ripe for the past hour, and Kefalla openly said as much an hour and a half ago, but he got such scathing things said to him about civilians’ legs by the sergeant that I did not air my own opinion.</p>
<p>We are now right at the very edge of the timber belt.  My head man and three boys are done to a turn.  If I had had a bull behind me or Mr. Fildes in front, I might have done another five or seven miles, but not more.</p>
<p>The rain comes down with extra virulence as soon as we set to work to start the fire and open the loads.  I and Peter have great times getting out the military camp-bed from its tight, bolster-like case, while Kefalla gives advice, until, being irritated by the bed’s behaviour, I blow up Kefalla and send him to chop firewood.  However, we get the thing out and put up after cutting a place clear to set it on; owing to the world being on a stiff slant hereabouts, it takes time to make it stand straight.  I get four stakes cut, and drive them in at the four corners of the bed, and then stretch over it Herr von Lucke’s waterproof ground-sheet, guy the ends out to pegs with string, feel profoundly grateful to both Herr Liebert for the bed and Herr von Lucke for the sheet, and place the baggage under the protection of the German Government’s two belongings.  Then I find the boys have not got a fire with all their fuss, and I have to demonstrate to them the lessons I have learnt among the Fans regarding fire-making.  We build a fire-house and then all goes well.  I notice they do not make a fire Fan fashion, but build it in a circle.</p>
<p>Evidently one of the labourers from Buea, named Xenia, is a good man.  Equally evidently some of my other men are only fit to carry sandwich-boards for Day and Martin’s blacking.  I dine luxuriously off tinned fat pork and hot tea, and then feeling still hungry go on to tinned herring.  Excellent thing tinned herring, but I have to hurry because I know I must go up through the edge of the forest on to the grass land, and see how the country is made during the brief period of clearness that almost always comes just before nightfall.  So leaving my boys comfortably seated round the fire having their evening chop, I pass up through the heavily lichen-tasselled fringe of the forest-belt into deep jungle grass, and up a steep and slippery mound.</p>
<p>In front the mountain-face rises like a wall from behind a set of hillocks, similar to the one I am at present on.  The face of the wall to the right and left has two dark clefts in it.  The peak itself is not visible from where I am; it rises behind and beyond the wall.  I stay taking compass bearings and look for an easy way up for to-morrow.  My men, by now, have missed their “ma” and are yelling for her dismally, and the night comes down with great rapidity for we are in the shadow of the great mountain mass, so I go back into camp.  Alas! how vain are often our most energetic efforts to remove our fellow creatures from temptation.  I knew a Sunday down among the soldiers would be bad for my men, and so came up here, and now, if you please, these men have been at the rum, because Bum, the head man, has been too done up to do anything but lie in his blanket and feed.  Kefalla is laying down the law with great detail and unction.  Cook who has been very low in his mind all day, is now weirdly cheerful, and sings incoherently.  The other boys, who want to go to sleep, threaten to “burst him” if he “no finish.”  It’s no good - cook carols on, and soon succumbing to the irresistible charm of music, the other men have to join in the choruses.  The performance goes on for an hour, growing woollier and woollier in tone, and then dying out in sleep.</p>
<p>I write by the light of an insect-haunted lantern, sitting on the bed, which is tucked in among the trees some twenty yards away from the boys’ fire.  There is a bird whistling in a deep rich note that I have never heard before.</p>
<p><i>September 23rd</i>. - Morning gloriously fine.  Rout the boys out, and start at seven, with Sasu, Head man, Xenia, Black boy, Kefalla and Cook.</p>
<p>The great south-east wall of the mountain in front of us is quite unflecked by cloud, and in the forest are thousands of bees.  We notice that the tongues of forest go up the mountain in some places a hundred yards or more above the true line of the belt.  These tongues of forest get more and more heavily hung with lichen, and the trees thinner and more stunted, towards their ends.  I think that these tongues are always in places where the wind does not get full play.  All those near our camping place on this south-east face are so.  It is evidently not a matter of soil, for there is ample soil on this side above where the trees are, and then again on the western side of the mountain - the side facing the sea - the timber line is far higher up than on this.  Nor, again, is it a matter of angle that makes the timber line here so low, for those forests on the Sierra del Cristal were growing luxuriantly over far steeper grades.  There is some peculiar local condition just here evidently, or the forest would be up to the bottom of the wall of the crater.  I am not unreasonable enough to expect it to grow on that, but its conduct in staying where it does requires explanation.</p>
<p>We clamber up into the long jungle grass region and go on our way across a series of steep-sided, rounded grass hillocks, each of which is separated from the others by dry, rocky watercourses.  The effects produced by the seed-ears of the long grass round us are very beautiful; they look a golden brown, and each ear and leaf is gemmed with dewdrops, and those of the grass on the sides of the hillocks at a little distance off show a soft brown-pink.</p>
<p>After half an hour’s climb, when we are close at the base of the wall, I observe the men ahead halting, and coming up with them find Monrovia Boy down a hole; a little deep blow-hole, in which, I am informed, water is supposed to be.  But Monrovia soon reports “No live.”</p>
<p>I now find we have not a drop of water, either with us or in camp, and now this hole has proved dry.  There is, says the sergeant, no chance of getting any more water on this side of the mountain, save down at the river at Buea.</p>
<p>This means failure unless tackled, and it is evidently a trick played on me by the boys, who intentionally failed to let me know of this want of water before leaving Buea, where it seems they have all learnt it.  I express my opinion of them in four words and send Monrovia Boy, who I know is to be trusted, back to Buea with a scribbled note to Herr Liebert asking him to send me up two demijohns of water.  I send cook with him as far as the camp in the forest we have just left with orders to bring up three bottles of soda water I have left there, and to instruct the men there that as soon as the water arrives from Buea they are to bring it on up to the camp I mean to make at the top of the wall.</p>
<p>The men are sulky, and Sasu, Peter, Kefalla, and Head man say they will wait and come on as soon as cook brings the soda water, and I go on, and presently see Xenia and Black boy are following me.  We get on to the intervening hillocks and commence to ascend the face of the wall.</p>
<p>The angle of this wall is great, and its appearance from below is impressive from its enormous breadth, and its abrupt rise without bend or droop for a good 2,000 feet into the air.  It is covered with short, yellowish grass through which the burnt-up, scoriaceous lava rock protrudes in rough masses.</p>
<p>I got on up the wall, which when you are on it is not so perpendicular as it looks from below, my desire being to see what sort of country there was on the top of it, between it and the final peak.  Sasu had reported to Herr Liebert that it was a wilderness of rock, in which it would be impossible to fix a tent, and spoke vaguely of caves.  Here and there on the way up I come to holes, similar to the one my men had been down for water.  I suppose these holes have been caused by gases from an under hot layer of lava bursting up through the upper cool layer.  As I get higher, the grass becomes shorter and more sparse, and the rocks more ostentatiously displayed.  Here and there among them are sadly tried bushes, bearing a beautiful yellow flower, like a large yellow wild rose, only scentless.  It is not a rose at all, I may remark.  The ground, where there is any basin made by the rocks, grows a great sedum, with a grand head of whity-pink flower, also a tall herb, with soft downy leaves silver grey in colour, and having a very pleasant aromatic scent, and here and there patches of good honest parsley.  Bright blue, flannelly-looking flowers stud the grass in sheltered places and a very pretty large green orchid is plentiful.  Above us is a bright blue sky with white cloud rushing hurriedly across it to the N.E. and a fierce sun.  When I am about half-way up, I think of those boys, and, wanting rest, sit down by an inviting-looking rock grotto, with a patch of the yellow flowered shrub growing on its top.  Inside it grow little ferns and mosses, all damp; but alas! no water pool, and very badly I want water by this time.</p>
<p>Below me a belt of white cloud had now formed, so that I could see neither the foot-hillocks nor the forest, and presently out of this mist came Xenia toiling up, carrying my black bag.  “Where them Black boy live?” said I.  “Black boy say him foot be tire too much,” said Xenia, as he threw himself down in the little shade the rock could give.  I took a cupful of sour claret out of the bottle in the bag, and told Xenia to come on up as soon as he was rested, and meanwhile to yell to the others down below and tell them to come on.  Xenia did, but sadly observed, “softly softly still hurts the snail,” and I left him and went on up the mountain.</p>
<p>When I had got to the top of the rock under which I had sheltered from the blazing sun, the mist opened a little, and I saw my men looking like so many little dolls.  They were still sitting on the hillock where I had left them.  Buea showed from this elevation well.  The guard house and the mission house, like little houses in a picture, and the make of the ground on which Buea station stands, came out distinctly as a ledge or terrace, extending for miles N.N.E. and S.S.W.  This ledge is a strange-looking piece of country, covered with low bush, out of which rise great, isolated, white-stemmed cotton trees.  Below, and beyond this is a denser band of high forest, and again below this stretches the vast mangrove-swamp fringing the estuary of the Cameroons, Mungo, and Bimbia rivers.  It is a very noble view, giving one an example of the peculiar beauty one oft-times gets in this West African scenery, namely colossal sweeps of colour.  The mangrove-swamps looked to-day like a vast damson-coloured carpet threaded with silver where the waterways ran.  It reminded me of a scene I saw once near Cabinda, when on climbing to the top of a hill I suddenly found myself looking down on a sheet of violet pink more than a mile long and half a mile wide.  This was caused by a climbing plant having taken possession of a valley full of trees, whose tops it had reached and then spread and interlaced itself over them, to burst into profuse glorious laburnum-shaped bunches of flowers.</p>
<p>After taking some careful compass bearings for future use regarding the Rumby and Omon range of mountains, which were clearly visible and which look fascinatingly like my beloved Sierra del Cristal, I turned my face to the wall of Mungo, and continued the ascent.  The sun, which was blazing, was reflected back from the rocks in scorching rays.  But it was more bearable now, because its heat was tempered by a bitter wind.</p>
<p>The slope becoming steeper, I gradually made my way towards the left until I came to a great lane, as neatly walled with rock as if it had been made with human hands.  It runs down the mountain face, nearly vertically in places and at stiff angles always, but it was easier going up this lane than on the outside rough rock, because the rocks in it had been smoothed by mountain torrents during thousands of wet seasons, and the walls protected one from the biting wind, a wind that went through me, for I had been stewing for nine months and more in tropic and equatorial swamps.</p>
<p>Up this lane I went to the very top of the mountain wall, and then, to my surprise, found myself facing a great, hillocky, rock-encumbered plain, across the other side of which rose the mass of the peak itself, not as a single cone, but as a wall surmounted by several, three being evidently the highest among them.</p>
<p>I started along the ridge of my wall, and went to its highest part, that to the S.W., intending to see what I could of the view towards the sea, and then to choose a place for camping in for the night.</p>
<p>When I reached the S.W. end, looking westwards I saw the South Atlantic down below, like a plain of frosted silver.  Out of it, barely twenty miles away, rose Fernando Po to its 10,190 feet with that majestic grace peculiar to a volcanic island.  Immediately below me, some 10,000 feet or so, lay Victoria with the forested foot-hills of Mungo Mah Lobeh encircling it as a diadem, and Ambas Bay gemmed with rocky islands lying before it.  On my left away S.E. was the glorious stretch of the Cameroon estuary, with a line of white cloud lying very neatly along the course of Cameroon River.</p>
<p>In one of the chasms of the mountain wall that I had come up - in the one furthest to the north - there was a thunderstorm brewing, seemingly hanging on to, or streaming out of the mountain side, a soft billowy mass of dense cream-coloured cloud, with flashes of golden lightnings playing about in it with soft growls of thunder.  Surely Mungo Mah Lobeh himself, of all the thousands he annually turns out, never made one more lovely than this.  Soon the white mists rose from the mangrove-swamp, and grew rose-colour in the light of the setting sun, as they swept upwards over the now purple high forests.  In the heavens, to the north, there was a rainbow, vivid in colour, one arch of it going behind the peak, the other sinking into the mist sea below, and this mist sea rose and rose towards me, turning from pale rose-colour to lavender, and where the shadow of Mungo lay across it, to a dull leaden grey.  It was soon at my feet, blotting the under-world out, and soon came flowing over the wall top at its lowest parts, stretching in great spreading rivers over the crater plain, and then these coalescing everything was shut out save the two summits: that of Cameroon close to me, and that of Clarence away on Fernando Po.  These two stood out alone, like great island masses made of iron rising from a formless, silken sea.</p>
<p>The space around seemed boundless, and there was in it neither sound nor colour, nor anything with form, save those two terrific things.  It was like a vision, and it held me spell-bound, as I stood shivering on the rocks with the white mist round my knees until into my wool-gathering mind came the memory of those anything but sublime men of mine; and I turned and scuttled off along the rocks like an agitated ant left alone in a dead Universe.</p>
<p>I soon found the place where I had come up into the crater plain and went down over the wall, descending with twice the rapidity, but ten times the scratches and grazes, of the ascent.</p>
<p>I picked up the place where I had left Xenia, but no Xenia was there, nor came there any answer to my bush call for him, so on I went down towards the place where, hours ago, I had left the men.  The mist was denser down below, but to my joy it was warmer than on the summit of the wind-swept wall.</p>
<p>I had nearly reached the foot of this wall and made my mind up to turn in for the night under a rock, when I heard a melancholy croak away in the mist to the left.  I went towards it and found Xenia lost on his own account, and distinctly quaint in manner, and then I recollected that I had been warned Xenia is slightly crazy.  Nice situation this: a madman on a mountain in the mist.  Xenia, I found, had no longer got my black bag, but in its place a lid of a saucepan and an empty lantern.  To put it mildly, this is not the sort of outfit the R.G.S.  <i>Hints to Travellers</i> would recommend for African exploration.  Xenia reported that he gave the bag to Black boy, who shortly afterwards disappeared, and that he had neither seen him nor any of the others since, and didn’t expect to this side of Srahmandazi.  In a homicidal state of mind, I made tracks for the missing ones followed by Xenia.  I thought mayhap they had grown on to the rocks they had sat upon so long, but presently, just before it became quite dark, we picked up the place we had left them in and found there only an empty soda-water bottle.  Xenia poured out a muddled mass of observations to the effect that “they got fright too much about them water palaver.”</p>
<p>I did not linger to raise a monument to them, but I said I wished they were in a condition to require one, and we went on over our hillocks with more confidence now that we knew we had stuck well to our unmarked track.</p>
<p>     “The moving Moon went up the sky,<br/>
        And nowhere did abide:<br/>
      Softly she was going up,<br/>
        And a star or two beside.”</p>
<p>Only she was a young and inefficient moon, and although we were below the thickest of the mist band, it was dark.  Finding our own particular hole in the forest wall was about as easy as finding “one particular rabbit hole in an unknown hay-field in the dark,” and the attempt to do so afforded us a great deal of varied exercise.  I am obliged to be guarded in my language, because my feelings now are only down to one degree below boiling point.  The rain now began to fall, thank goodness, and I drew the thick ears of grass through my parched lips as I stumbled along over the rugged lumps of rock hidden under the now waist-high jungle grass.</p>
<p>Our camp hole was pretty easily distinguishable by daylight, for it was on the left-hand side of one of the forest tongues, the grass land running down like a lane between two tongues here, and just over the entrance three conspicuously high trees showed.  But we could not see these “picking-up” points in the darkness, so I had to keep getting Xenia to strike matches, and hold them in his hat while I looked at the compass.  Presently we came full tilt up against a belt of trees which I knew from these compass observations was our tongue of forest belt, and I fired a couple of revolver shots into it, whereabouts I judged our camp to be.</p>
<p>This was instantly answered by a yell from human voices in chorus, and towards that yell in a slightly amiable - a very slightly amiable - state of mind I went.</p>
<p>I will draw a veil over the scene, particularly over my observations to those men.  They did not attempt to deny their desertion, but they attempted to explain it, each one saying that it was not he but the other boy who “got fright too much.”</p>
<p>I closed the palaver promptly with a brief but lurid sketch of my opinion on the situation, and ordered food, for not having had a thing save that cup of sour claret since 6.30 A.M., and it being now 11 P.M., I felt sinkings.  Then arose another beautiful situation before me.  It seems when Cook and Monrovia got back into camp this morning Master Cook was seized with one of those attacks of a desire to manage things that produce such awful results in the African servant, and sent all the beef and rice down to Buea to be cooked, because there was no water here to cook it.  Therefore the men have got nothing to eat.  I had a few tins of my own food and so gave them some, and they became as happy as kings in a few minutes, listening and shouting over the terrible adventures of Xenia, who is posing as the Hero of the Great Cameroon.  I get some soda-water from the two bottles left and some tinned herring, and then write out two notes to Herr Liebert asking him to send me three more demijohns of water, and some beef and rice from the store, promising faithfully to pay for them on my return.</p>
<p>I would not prevent those men of mine from going up that peak above me after their touching conduct to-day.  Oh! no; not for worlds, dear things.</p>
