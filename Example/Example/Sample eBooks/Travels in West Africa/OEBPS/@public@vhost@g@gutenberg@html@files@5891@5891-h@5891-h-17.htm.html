<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, TRAVELS IN WEST AFRICA ***<br/></p>
<div class="pgmonospaced pgheader"><br/>******This file should be named 5891.htm or 5891.zip******<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.<br/><br/>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br/>of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br/>Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br/>even years after the official publication date.<br/><br/>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br/>midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br/>The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br/>Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br/>preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br/>and editing by those who wish to do so.<br/><br/>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br/>http://gutenberg.net or<br/>http://promo.net/pg<br/><br/>These Web sites include award-winning information about Project<br/>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new<br/>eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).<br/><br/><br/>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br/>can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br/>also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br/>indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br/>announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.<br/><br/>http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or<br/>ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04<br/><br/>Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90<br/><br/>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,<br/>as it appears in our Newsletters.<br/><br/><br/>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)<br/><br/>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br/>time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br/>to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br/>searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br/>projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br/>per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br/>million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br/>files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br/>We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br/>If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br/>will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.<br/><br/>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br/>This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br/>which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.<br/><br/>Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):<br/><br/>eBooks Year

Hart<br/>through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br/>Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br/>on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br/>distribute it in the United States without permission and<br/>without paying copyright royalties.

Among other<br/>things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br/>intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br/>disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br/>codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.<br/><br/>LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES<br/>But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,<br/>[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may<br/>receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims<br/>all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including<br/>legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR<br/>UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,<br/>INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE<br/>OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE<br/>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/><br/>If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of<br/>receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)<br/>you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br/>time to the person you received it from.
