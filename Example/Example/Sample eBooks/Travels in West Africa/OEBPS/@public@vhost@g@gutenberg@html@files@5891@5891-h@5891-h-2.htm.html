<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br/>
<br/></div>
<p class="c1">Wherein the voyager before leaving the Rivers discourses on dangers, to which is added some account of Mangrove swamps and the creatures that abide therein.</p>
<p>I left Calabar in May and joined the <i>Benguela</i> off Lagos Bar.  My voyage down coast in her was a very pleasant one and full of instruction, for Mr. Fothergill, who was her purser, had in former years resided in Congo Français as a merchant, and to Congo Français I was bound with an empty hold as regards local knowledge of the district.  He was one of that class of men, of which you most frequently find representatives among the merchants, who do not possess the power so many men along here do possess (a power that always amazes me), of living for a considerable time in a district without taking any interest in it, keeping their whole attention concentrated on the point of how long it will be before their time comes to get out of it.  Mr. Fothergill evidently had much knowledge and experience of the Fernan Vaz district and its natives.  He had, I should say, overdone his experiences with the natives, as far as personal comfort and pleasure at the time went, having been nearly killed and considerably chivied by them.  Now I do not wish a man, however much I may deplore his total lack of local knowledge, to go so far as this.  Mr. Fothergill gave his accounts of these incidents calmly, and in an undecorated way that gave them a power and convincingness verging on being unpleasant, although useful, to a person who was going into the district where they had occurred, for one felt there was no mortal reason why one should not personally get involved in similar affairs.  And I must here acknowledge the great subsequent service Mr. Fothergill’s wonderfully accurate descriptions of the peculiar characteristics of the Ogowé forests were to me when I subsequently came to deal with these forests on my own account, as every district of forest has peculiar characteristics of its own which you require to know.  I should like here to speak of West Coast dangers because I fear you may think that I am careless of, or do not believe in them, neither of which is the case.  The more you know of the West Coast of Africa, the more you realise its dangers.  For example, on your first voyage out you hardly believe the stories of fever told by the old Coasters.  That is because you do not then understand the type of man who is telling them, a man who goes to his death with a joke in his teeth.  But a short experience of your own, particularly if you happen on a place having one of its periodic epidemics, soon demonstrates that the underlying horror of the thing is there, a rotting corpse which the old Coaster has dusted over with jokes to cover it so that it hardly shows at a distance, but which, when you come yourself to live alongside, you soon become cognisant of.  Many men, when they have got ashore and settled, realise this, and let the horror get a grip on them; a state briefly and locally described as funk, and a state that usually ends fatally; and you can hardly blame them.  Why, I know of a case myself.  A young man who had never been outside an English country town before in his life, from family reverses had to take a situation as book-keeper down in the Bights.  The factory he was going to was in an isolated out-of-the-way place and not in a settlement, and when the ship called off it, he was put ashore in one of the ship’s boats with his belongings, and a case or so of goods.  There were only the firm’s beach-boys down at the surf, and as the steamer was in a hurry the officer from the ship did not go up to the factory with him, but said good-bye and left him alone with a set of naked savages as he thought, but really of good kindly Kru boys on the beach.  He could not understand what they said, nor they what he said, and so he walked up to the house and on to the verandah and tried to find the Agent he had come out to serve under.  He looked into the open-ended dining-room and shyly round the verandah, and then sat down and waited for some one to turn up.  Sundry natives turned up, and said a good deal, but no one white or comprehensible, so in desperation he made another and a bolder tour completely round the verandah and noticed a most peculiar noise in one of the rooms and an infinity of flies going into the venetian shuttered window.  Plucking up courage he went in and found what was left of the white Agent, a considerable quantity of rats, and most of the flies in West Africa.  He then presumably had fever, and he was taken off, a fortnight afterwards, by a French boat, to whom the natives signalled, and he is not coming down the Coast again.  Some men would have died right out from a shock like this.</p>
<p>But most of the new-comers do not get a shock of this order.  They either die themselves or get more gradually accustomed to this sort of thing, when they come to regard death and fever as soldiers, who on a battle-field sit down, and laugh and talk round a camp fire after a day’s hard battle, in which they have seen their friends and companions falling round them; all the time knowing that to-morrow the battle comes again and that to-morrow night they themselves may never see.</p>
<p>It is not hard-hearted callousness, it is only their way.  Michael Scott put this well in <i>Tom Cringle’s Log</i>, in his account of the yellow fever during the war in the West Indies.  Fever, though the chief danger, particularly to people who go out to settlements, is not the only one; but as the other dangers, except perhaps domestic poisoning, are incidental to pottering about in the forests, or on the rivers, among the unsophisticated tribes, I will not dwell on them.  They can all be avoided by any one with common sense, by keeping well out of the districts in which they occur; and so I warn the general reader that if he goes out to West Africa, it is not because I said the place was safe, or its dangers overrated.  The cemeteries of the West Coast are full of the victims of those people who have said that Coast fever is “Cork fever,” and a man’s own fault, which it is not; and that natives will never attack you unless you attack them: which they will - on occasions.</p>
<p>My main aim in going to Congo Français was to get up above the tide line of the Ogowé River and there collect fishes; for my object on this voyage was to collect fish from a river north of the Congo.  I had hoped this river would have been the Niger, for Sir George Goldie had placed at my disposal great facilities for carrying on work there in comfort; but for certain private reasons I was disinclined to go from the Royal Niger Protectorate into the Royal Niger Company’s territory; and the Calabar, where Sir Claude MacDonald did everything he possibly could to assist me, I did not find a good river for me to collect fishes in.  These two rivers failing me, from no fault of either of their own presiding genii, my only hope of doing anything now lay on the South West Coast river, the Ogowé, and everything there depended on Mr. Hudson’s attitude towards scientific research in the domain of ichthyology.  Fortunately for me that gentleman elected to take a favourable view of this affair, and in every way in his power assisted me during my entire stay in Congo Français.  But before I enter into a detailed description of this wonderful bit of West Africa, I must give you a brief notice of the manners, habits and customs of West Coast rivers in general, to make the thing more intelligible.</p>
<p>There is an uniformity in the habits of West Coast rivers, from the Volta to the Coanza, which is, when you get used to it, very taking.  Excepting the Congo, the really great river comes out to sea with as much mystery as possible; lounging lazily along among its mangrove swamps in a what’s-it-matter-when-one-comes-out and where’s-the-hurry style, through quantities of channels inter-communicating with each other.  Each channel, at first sight as like the other as peas in a pod, is bordered on either side by green-black walls of mangroves, which Captain Lugard graphically described as seeming “as if they had lost all count of the vegetable proprieties, and were standing on stilts with their branches tucked up out of the wet, leaving their gaunt roots exposed in midair.”  High-tide or low-tide, there is little difference in the water; the river, be it broad or narrow, deep or shallow, looks like a pathway of polished metal; for it is as heavy weighted with stinking mud as water e’er can be, ebb or flow, year out and year in.  But the difference in the banks, though an unending alternation between two appearances, is weird.</p>
<p>At high-water you do not see the mangroves displaying their ankles in the way that shocked Captain Lugard.  They look most respectable, their foliage rising densely in a wall irregularly striped here and there by the white line of an aërial root, coming straight down into the water from some upper branch as straight as a plummet, in the strange, knowing way an aërial root of a mangrove does, keeping the hard straight line until it gets some two feet above water-level, and then spreading out into blunt fingers with which to dip into the water and grasp the mud.  Banks indeed at high water can hardly be said to exist, the water stretching away into the mangrove swamps for miles and miles, and you can then go, in a suitable small canoe, away among these swamps as far as you please.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating pursuit.  But it is a pleasure to be indulged in with caution; for one thing, you are certain to come across crocodiles.  Now a crocodile drifting down in deep water, or lying asleep with its jaws open on a sand-bank in the sun, is a picturesque adornment to the landscape when you are on the deck of a steamer, and you can write home about it and frighten your relations on your behalf; but when you are away among the swamps in a small dug-out canoe, and that crocodile and his relations are awake - a thing he makes a point of being at flood tide because of fish coming along - and when he has got his foot upon his native heath - that is to say, his tail within holding reach of his native mud - he is highly interesting, and you may not be able to write home about him - and you get frightened on your own behalf; for crocodiles can, and often do, in such places, grab at people in small canoes.  I have known of several natives losing their lives in this way; some native villages are approachable from the main river by a short cut, as it were, through the mangrove swamps, and the inhabitants of such villages will now and then go across this way with small canoes instead of by the constant channel to the village, which is almost always winding.  In addition to this unpleasantness you are liable - until you realise the danger from experience, or have native advice on the point - to get tide-trapped away in the swamps, the water falling round you when you are away in some deep pool or lagoon, and you find you cannot get back to the main river.  Of course if you really want a truly safe investment in Fame, and really care about Posterity, and Posterity’s Science, you will jump over into the black batter-like, stinking slime, cheered by the thought of the terrific sensation you will produce 20,000 years hence, and the care you will be taken of then by your fellow-creatures, in a museum.  But if you are a mere ordinary person of a retiring nature, like me, you stop in your lagoon until the tide rises again; most of your attention is directed to dealing with an “at home” to crocodiles and mangrove flies, and with the fearful stench of the slime round you.  What little time you have over you will employ in wondering why you came to West Africa, and why, after having reached this point of folly, you need have gone and painted the lily and adorned the rose, by being such a colossal ass as to come fooling about in mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Still, even if your own peculiar tastes and avocations do not take you in small dug-out canoes into the heart of the swamps, you can observe the difference in the local scenery made by the flowing of the tide when you are on a vessel stuck on a sand-bank, in the Rio del Rey for example.  Moreover, as you will have little else to attend to, save mosquitoes and mangrove flies, when in such a situation, you may as well pursue the study.  At the ebb gradually the foliage of the lower branches of the mangroves grows wet and muddy, until there is a great black band about three feet deep above the surface of the water in all directions; gradually a network of gray-white roots rises up, and below this again, gradually, a slope of smooth and lead-grey slime.  The effect is not in the least as if the water had fallen, but as if the mangroves had, with one accord, risen up out of it, and into it again they seem silently to sink when the flood comes.  But by this more safe, if still unpleasant, method of observing mangrove-swamps, you miss seeing in full the make of them, for away in their fastnesses the mangroves raise their branches far above the reach of tide line, and the great gray roots of the older trees are always sticking up in mid-air.  But, fringing the rivers, there is always a hedge of younger mangroves whose lower branches get immersed.</p>
<p>At corners here and there from the river face you can see the land being made from the waters.  A mud-bank forms off it, a mangrove seed lights on it, and the thing’s done.  Well! not done, perhaps, but begun; for if the bank is high enough to get exposed at low water, this pioneer mangrove grows.  He has a wretched existence though.  You have only got to look at his dwarfed attenuated form to see this.  He gets joined by a few more bold spirits and they struggle on together, their network of roots stopping abundance of mud, and by good chance now and then a consignment of miscellaneous <i>débris</i> of palm leaves, or a floating tree-trunk, but they always die before they attain any considerable height.  Still even in death they collect.  Their bare white stems remaining like a net gripped in the mud, so that these pioneer mangrove heroes may be said to have laid down their lives to make that mud-bank fit for colonisation, for the time gradually comes when other mangroves can and do colonise on it, and flourish, extending their territory steadily; and the mud-bank joins up with, and becomes a part of, Africa.</p>
<p>Right away on the inland fringe of the swamp - you may go some hundreds of miles before you get there - you can see the rest of the process.  The mangroves there have risen up, and dried the mud to an extent that is more than good for themselves, have over civilised that mud in fact, and so the brackish waters of the tide - which, although their enemy when too deep or too strong in salt, is essential to their existence - cannot get to their roots.  They have done this gradually, as a mangrove does all things, but they have done it, and down on to that mud come a whole set of palms from the old mainland, who in their early colonisation days go through similarly trying experiences.  First the screw-pines come and live among them; then the wine-palm and various creepers, and then the oil-palm; and the <i>débris</i> of these plants being greater and making better soil than dead mangroves, they work quicker and the mangrove is doomed.  Soon the salt waters are shut right out, the mangrove dies, and that bit of Africa is made.  It is very interesting to get into these regions; you see along the river-bank a rich, thick, lovely wall of soft-wooded plants, and behind this you find great stretches of death; - miles and miles sometimes of gaunt white mangrove skeletons standing on gray stuff that is not yet earth and is no longer slime, and through the crust of which you can sink into rotting putrefaction.  Yet, long after you are dead, buried, and forgotten, this will become a forest of soft-wooded plants and palms; and finally of hard-wooded trees.  Districts of this description you will find in great sweeps of Kama country for example, and in the rich low regions up to the base of the Sierra del Cristal and the Rumby range.</p>
<p>You often hear the utter lifelessness of mangrove-swamps commented on; why I do not know, for they are fairly heavily stocked with fauna, though the species are comparatively few.  There are the crocodiles, more of them than any one wants; there are quantities of flies, particularly the big silent mangrove-fly which lays an egg in you under the skin; the egg becomes a maggot and stays there until it feels fit to enter into external life.  Then there are “slimy things that crawl with legs upon a slimy sea,” and any quantity of hopping mud-fish, and crabs, and a certain mollusc, and in the water various kinds of cat-fish.  Birdless they are save for the flocks of gray parrots that pass over them at evening, hoarsely squarking; and save for this squarking of the parrots the swamps are silent all the day, at least during the dry season; in the wet season there is no silence night or day in West Africa, but that roar of the descending deluge of rain that is more monotonous and more gloomy than any silence can be.  In the morning you do not hear the long, low, mellow whistle of the plantain-eaters calling up the dawn, nor in the evening the clock-bird nor the Handel-Festival-sized choruses of frogs, or the crickets, that carry on their vesper controversy of “she did” - “she didn’t” so fiercely on hard land.</p>
<p>But the mangrove-swamp follows the general rule for West Africa, and night in it is noisier than the day.  After dark it is full of noises; grunts from I know not what, splashes from jumping fish, the peculiar whirr of rushing crabs, and quaint creaking and groaning sounds from the trees; and - above all in eeriness - the strange whine and sighing cough of crocodiles.</p>
<p>Great regions of mangrove-swamps are a characteristic feature of the West African Coast.  The first of these lies north of Sierra Leone; then they occur, but of smaller dimensions - just fringes of river-outfalls - until you get to Lagos, when you strike the greatest of them all: - the swamps of the Niger outfalls (about twenty-three rivers in all) and of the Sombreiro, New Calabar, Bonny, San Antonio, Opobo (false and true), Kwoibo, Old Calabar (with the Cross Akwayafe Qwa Rivers) and Rio del Rey Rivers.  The whole of this great stretch of coast is a mangrove-swamp, each river silently rolling down its great mass of mud-laden waters and constituting each in itself a very pretty problem to the navigator by its network of intercommunicating creeks, and the sand and mud bar which it forms off its entrance by dropping its heaviest mud; its lighter mud is carried out beyond its bar and makes the nasty-smelling brown soup of the South Atlantic Ocean, with froth floating in lines and patches on it, for miles to seaward.</p>
<p>In this great region of swamps every mile appears like every other mile until you get well used to it, and are able to distinguish the little local peculiarities at the entrance of the rivers and in the winding of the creeks, a thing difficult even for the most experienced navigator to do during those thick wool-like mists called smokes, which hang about the whole Bight from November till May (the dry season), sometimes lasting all day, sometimes clearing off three hours after sunrise.</p>
<p>The upper or north-westerly part of the swamp is round the mouths of the Niger, and it successfully concealed this fact from geographers down to 1830, when the series of heroic journeys made by Mungo Park, Clapperton, and the two Landers finally solved the problem - a problem that was as great and which cost more men’s lives than even the discovery of the sources of the Nile.</p>
<p>That this should have been so may seem very strange to us who now have been told the answer to the riddle; for the upper waters of this great river were known of before Christ and spoken of by Herodotus, Pliny and Ptolemy, and its mouths navigated continuously along by the seaboard by trading vessels since the fifteenth century, but they were not recognised as belonging to the Niger.  Some geographers held that the Senegal or the Gambia was its outfall; others that it was the Zaire (Congo); others that it did not come out on the West Coast at all, but got mixed up with the Nile in the middle of the continent, and so on.  Yet when you come to know the swamps this is not so strange.  You find on going up what looks like a big river - say Forcados, two and a half miles wide at the entrance and a real bit of the Niger.  Before you are up it far great, broad, business-like-looking river entrances open on either side, showing wide rivers mangrove-walled, but two-thirds of them are utter frauds which will ground you within half an hour of your entering them.  Some few of them do communicate with other main channels to the great upper river, and others are main channels themselves; but most of them intercommunicate with each other and lead nowhere in particular, and you can’t even get there because of their shallowness.  It is small wonder that the earlier navigators did not get far up them in sailing ships, and that the problem had to be solved by men descending the main stream of the Niger before it commences to what we in Devonshire should call “squander itself about” in all these channels.  And in addition it must be remembered that the natives with whom these trading vessels dealt, first for slaves, afterwards for palm-oil, were not, and are not now, members of the Lo family of savages.  Far from it: they do not go in for “gentle smiles,” but for murdering any unprotected boat’s crew they happen to come across, not only for a love of sport but to keep white traders from penetrating to the trade-producing interior, and spoiling prices.  And the region is practically foodless.</p>
<p>The rivers of the great mangrove-swamp from the Sombreiro to the Rio del Rey are now known pretty surely not to be branches of the Niger, but the upper regions of this part of the Bight are much neglected by English explorers.  I believe the great swamp region of the Bight of Biafra is the greatest in the world, and that in its immensity and gloom it has a grandeur equal to that of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Take any man, educated or not, and place him on Bonny or Forcados River in the wet season on a Sunday - Bonny for choice.  Forcados is good.  You’ll keep Forcados scenery “indelibly limned on the tablets of your mind when a yesterday has faded from its page,” after you have spent even a week waiting for the Lagos branch-boat on its inky waters.  But Bonny!  Well, come inside the bar and anchor off the factories: seaward there is the foam of the bar gleaming and wicked white against a leaden sky and what there is left of Breaker Island.  In every other direction you will see the apparently endless walls of mangrove, unvarying in colour, unvarying in form, unvarying in height, save from perspective.  Beneath and between you and them lie the rotting mud waters of Bonny River, and away up and down river, miles of rotting mud waters fringed with walls of rotting mud mangrove-swamp.  The only break in them - one can hardly call it a relief to the scenery - are the gaunt black ribs of the old hulks, once used as trading stations, which lie exposed at low water near the shore, protruding like the skeletons of great unclean beasts who have died because Bonny water was too strong even for them.</p>
<p>Raised on piles from the mud shore you will see the white-painted factories and their great store-houses for oil; each factory likely enough with its flag at half-mast, which does not enliven the scenery either, for you know it is because somebody is “dead again.”  Throughout and over all is the torrential downpour of the wet-season rain, coming down night and day with its dull roar.  I have known it rain six mortal weeks in Bonny River, just for all the world as if it were done by machinery, and the interval that came then was only a few wet days, where-after it settled itself down to work again in the good West Coast waterspout pour for more weeks.</p>
<p>While your eyes are drinking in the characteristics of Bonny scenery you notice a peculiar smell - an intensification of that smell you noticed when nearing Bonny, in the evening, out at sea.  That’s the breath of the malarial mud, laden with fever, and the chances are you will be down to-morrow.  If it is near evening time now, you can watch it becoming incarnate, creeping and crawling and gliding out from the side creeks and between the mangrove-roots, laying itself upon the river, stretching and rolling in a kind of grim play, and finally crawling up the side of the ship to come on board and leave its cloak of moisture that grows green mildew in a few hours over all.  Noise you will not be much troubled with: there is only that rain, a sound I have known make men who are sick with fever well-nigh mad, and now and again the depressing cry of the curlews which abound here.  This combination is such that after six or eight hours of it you will be thankful to hear your shipmates start to work the winch.  I take it you are hard up when you relish a winch.  And you will say - let your previous experience of the world be what it may - Good Heavens, what a place!</p>
<p>Five times have I been now in Bonny River and I like it.  You always do get to like it if you live long enough to allow the strange fascination of the place to get a hold on you; but when I first entered it, on a ship commanded by Captain Murray in ’93, in the wet season, <i>i.e</i>. in August, in spite of the confidence I had by this time acquired in his skill and knowledge of the West Coast, a sense of horror seized on me as I gazed upon the scene, and I said to the old Coaster who then had charge of my education, “Good Heavens! what an awful accident.  We’ve gone and picked up the Styx.”  He was evidently hurt and said, “Bonny was a nice place when you got used to it,” and went on to discourse on the last epidemic here, when nine men out of the resident eleven died in about ten days from yellow fever.  Next to the scenery of “a River,” commend me for cheerfulness to the local conversation of its mangrove-swamp region; and every truly important West African river has its mangrove-swamp belt, which extends inland as far as the tide waters make it brackish, and which has a depth and extent from the banks depending on the configuration of the country.  Above this belt comes uniformly a region of high forest, having towards the river frontage clay cliffs, sometimes high, as in the case of the Old Calabar at Adiabo, more frequently dwarf cliffs, as in the Forcados up at Warree, and in the Ogowé, - for a long stretch through Kama country.  After the clay cliffs region you come to a region of rapids, caused by the river cutting its way through a mountain range; such ranges are the Pallaballa, causing the Livingstone rapids of the Congo; the Sierra del Cristal, those of the Ogowé, and many lesser rivers; the Rumby and Omon ranges, those of the Old Calabar and Cross Rivers.</p>
<p>Naturally in different parts these separate regions vary in size.  The mangrove-swamp may be only a fringe at the mouth of the river, or it may cover hundreds of square miles.  The clay cliffs may extend for only a mile or so along the bank, or they may, as on the Ogowé, extend for 130.  And so it is also with the rapids: in some rivers, for instance the Cameroons, there are only a few miles of them, in others there are many miles; in the Ogowé there are as many as 500; and these rapids may be close to the river mouth, as in most of the Gold Coast rivers, save the Ancobra and the Volta; or they may be far in the interior, as in the Cross River, where they commence at about 200 miles; and on the Ogowé, where they commence at about 208 miles from the sea coast; this depends on the nearness or remoteness from the coast line of the mountain ranges which run down the west side of the continent; ranges (apparently of very different geological formations), which have no end of different names, but about which little is known in detail. <a id="citation80"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote80" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{80}</a></p>
<p>And now we will leave generalisations on West African rivers and go into particulars regarding one little known in England, and called by its owners, the French, the greatest strictly equatorial river in the world - the Ogowé.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00008">CHAPTER IV.  THE OGOWÉ.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br/>
<br/></div>
<p><i>Wherein the voyager gives extracts from the Log of the</i> Mové<i>and of the</i> Éclaireur<i>, and an account of the voyager’s first meeting with “those fearful Fans,” also an awful warning to all young persons who neglect the study of the French language.</i></p>
<p>On the 20th of May I reached Gaboon, now called Libreville - the capital of Congo Français, and, thanks to the kindness of Mr. Hudson, I was allowed a passage on a small steamer then running from Gaboon to the Ogowé River, and up it when necessary as far as navigation by steamer is possible - this steamer is, I deeply regret to say, now no more.  As experiences of this kind contain such miscellaneous masses of facts, I am forced to commit the literary crime of giving you my Ogowé set of experiences in the form of diary.</p>
<p><i>June 5th</i>, 1895. - Off on <i>Mové</i> at 9.30.  Passengers, Mr. Hudson, Mr. Woods, Mr. Huyghens, Père Steinitz, and I.  There are black deck-passengers galore; I do not know their honourable names, but they are evidently very much married men, for there is quite a gorgeously coloured little crowd of ladies to see them off.  They salute me as I pass down the pier, and start inquiries.  I say hastily to them: “Farewell, I’m off up river,” for I notice Mr. Fildes bearing down on me, and I don’t want him to drop in on the subject of society interest.  I expect it is settled now, or pretty nearly.  There is a considerable amount of mild uproar among the black contingent, and the <i>Mové</i> firmly clears off before half the good advice and good wishes for the black husbands are aboard.  She is a fine little vessel; far finer than I expected.  The accommodation I am getting is excellent.  A long, narrow cabin, with one bunk in it and pretty nearly everything one can wish for, and a copying press thrown in.  Food is excellent, society charming, captain and engineer quite acquisitions.  The saloon is square and roomy for the size of the vessel, and most things, from rowlocks to teapots, are kept under the seats in good nautical style.  We call at the guard-ship to pass our papers, and then steam ahead out of the Gaboon estuary to the south, round Pongara Point, keeping close into the land.  About forty feet from shore there is a good free channel for vessels with a light draught which if you do not take, you have to make a big sweep seaward to avoid a reef.  Between four and five miles below Pongara, we pass Point Gombi, which is fitted with a lighthouse, a lively and conspicuous structure by day as well as night.  It is perched on a knoll, close to the extremity of the long arm of low, sandy ground, and is painted black and white, in horizontal bands, which, in conjunction with its general figure, give it a pagoda-like appearance.</p>
<p>Alongside it are a white-painted, red-roofed house for the lighthouse keeper, and a store for its oil.  The light is either a flashing or a revolving or a stationary one, when it is alight.  One must be accurate about these things, and my knowledge regarding it is from information received, and amounts to the above.  I cannot throw in any personal experience, because I have never passed it at night-time, and seen from Glass it seems just steady.  Most lighthouses on this Coast give up fancy tricks, like flashing or revolving, pretty soon after they are established.  Seventy-five per cent. of them are not alight half the time at all.  “It’s the climate.”  Gombi, however, you may depend on for being alight at night, and I have no hesitation in saying you can see it, when it is visible, seventeen miles out to sea, and that the knoll on which the lighthouse stands is a grass-covered sand cliff, about forty or fifty feet above sea-level.  As we pass round Gombi point, the weather becomes distinctly rough, particularly at lunch-time.  The <i>Mové</i> minds it less than her passengers, and stamps steadily along past the wooded shore, behind which shows a distant range of blue hills.  Silence falls upon the black passengers, who assume recumbent positions on the deck, and suffer.  All the things from under the saloon seats come out and dance together, and play puss-in-the-corner, after the fashion of loose gear when there is any sea on.  As the night comes down, the scene becomes more and more picturesque.  The moonlit sea, shimmering and breaking on the darkened shore, the black forest and the hills silhouetted against the star-powdered purple sky, and, at my feet, the engine-room stoke-hole, lit with the rose-coloured glow from its furnace, showing by the great wood fire the two nearly naked Krumen stokers, shining like polished bronze in their perspiration, as they throw in on to the fire the billets of red wood that look like freshly-cut chunks of flesh.  The white engineer hovers round the mouth of the pit, shouting down directions and ever and anon plunging down the little iron ladder to carry them out himself.  At intervals he stands on the rail with his head craned round the edge of the sun deck to listen to the captain, who is up on the little deck above, for there is no telegraph to the engines, and our gallant commander’s voice is not strong.  While the white engineer is roosting on the rail, the black engineer comes partially up the ladder and gazes hard at me; so I give him a wad of tobacco, and he plainly regards me as inspired, for of course that was what he wanted.  Remember that whenever you see a man, black or white, filled with a nameless longing, it is tobacco he requires.  Grim despair accompanied by a gusty temper indicates something wrong with his pipe, in which case offer him a straightened-out hairpin.  The black engineer having got his tobacco, goes below to the stoke-hole again and smokes a short clay as black and as strong as himself.  The captain affects an immense churchwarden.  How he gets through life, waving it about as he does, without smashing it every two minutes, I cannot make out.</p>
<p>At last we anchor for the night just inside Nazareth Bay, for Nazareth Bay wants daylight to deal with, being rich in low islands and sand shoals.  We crossed the Equator this afternoon.</p>
<p><i>June 6th</i>. - Off at daybreak into Nazareth Bay.  Anxiety displayed by navigators, sounding taken on both sides of the bows with long bamboo poles painted in stripes, and we go “slow ahead” and “hard astern” successfully, until we get round a good-sized island, and there we stick until four o’clock, high water, when we come off all right, and steam triumphantly but cautiously into the Ogowé.  The shores of Nazareth Bay are fringed with mangroves, but once in the river the scenery soon changes, and the waters are walled on either side with a forest rich in bamboo, oil and wine-palms.  These forest cliffs seem to rise right up out of the mirror-like brown water.  Many of the highest trees are covered with clusters of brown-pink young shoots that look like flowers, and others are decorated by my old enemy the climbing palm, now bearing clusters of bright crimson berries.  Climbing plants of other kinds are wreathing everything, some blossoming with mauve, some with yellow, some with white flowers, and every now and then a soft sweet heavy breath of fragrance comes out to us as we pass by.  There is a native village on the north bank, embowered along its plantations with some very tall cocoa-palms rising high above them.</p>
<p>The river winds so that it seems to close in behind us, opening out in front fresh vistas of superb forest beauty, with the great brown river stretching away unbroken ahead like a broad road of burnished bronze.  Astern, it has a streak of frosted silver let into it by the <i>Mové’s</i> screw.  Just about six o’clock, we run up to the <i>Fallaba</i>, the <i>Mové’s</i> predecessor in working the Ogowé, now a hulk, used as a depot by Hatton and Cookson.  She is anchored at the entrance of a creek that runs through to the Fernan Vaz; some say it is six hours’ run, others that it is eight hours for a canoe; all agree that there are plenty of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The <i>Fallaba</i> looks grimly picturesque, and about the last spot in which a person of a nervous disposition would care to spend the night.  One half of her deck is dedicated to fuel logs, on the other half are plank stores for the goods, and a room for the black sub-trader in charge of them.  I know that there must be scorpions which come out of those logs and stroll into the living room, and goodness only knows what one might not fancy would come up the creek or rise out of the floating grass, or the limitless-looking forest.  I am told she was a fine steamer in her day, but those who had charge of her did not make allowances for the very rapid rotting action of the Ogowé water, so her hull rusted through before her engines were a quarter worn out; and there was nothing to be done with her then, but put a lot of concrete in, and make her a depot, in which state of life she is very useful, for during the height of the dry season, the <i>Mové</i> cannot get through the creek to supply the firm’s Fernan Vaz factories.</p>
<p>Subsequently I heard much of the <i>Fallaba</i>, which seems to have been a celebrated, or rather notorious, vessel.  Every one declared her engines to have been of immense power, but this I believe to have been a mere local superstition; because in the same breath, the man who referred to them, as if it would have been quite unnecessary for new engines to have been made for H.M.S.  <i>Victorious</i> if those <i>Fallaba</i> engines could have been sent to Chatham dockyard, would mention that “you could not get any pace up on her”; and all who knew her sadly owned “she wouldn’t steer,” so naturally she spent the greater part of her time on the Ogowé on a sand-bank, or in the bush.  All West African steamers have a mania for bush, and the delusion that they are required to climb trees.  The <i>Fallaba</i> had the complaint severely, because of her defective steering powers, and the temptation the magnificent forest, and the rapid currents, and the sharp turns of the creek district, offered her; she failed, of course - they all fail - but it is not for want of practice.  I have seen many West Coast vessels up trees, but never more than fifteen feet or so.</p>
<p>The trade of this lower part of the Ogowé, from the mouth to Lembarene, a matter of 130 miles, is almost <i>nil</i>.  Above Lembarene, you are in touch with the rubber and ivory trade.</p>
<p>This <i>Fallaba</i> creek is noted for mosquitoes, and the black passengers made great and showy preparations in the evening time to receive their onslaught, by tying up their strong chintz mosquito bars to the stanchions and the cook-house.  Their arrangements being constantly interrupted by the white engineer making alarums and excursions amongst them; because when too many of them get on one side the <i>Mové</i> takes a list and burns her boilers.  Conversation and atmosphere are full of mosquitoes.  The decision of widely experienced sufferers amongst us is, that next to the lower Ogowé, New Orleans is the worst place for them in this world.</p>
<p>The day closed with a magnificent dramatic beauty.  Dead ahead of us, up through a bank of dun-coloured mist rose the moon, a great orb of crimson, spreading down the oil-like, still river, a streak of blood-red reflection.  Right astern, the sun sank down into the mist, a vaster orb of crimson, and when he had gone out of view, sent up flushes of amethyst, gold, carmine and serpent-green, before he left the moon in undisputed possession of the black purple sky.</p>
<p>Forest and river were absolutely silent, but there was a pleasant chatter and laughter from the black crew and passengers away forward, that made the <i>Mové</i> seem an island of life in a land of death.  I retired into my cabin, so as to get under the mosquito curtains to write; and one by one I heard my companions come into the saloon adjacent, and say to the watchman: “You sabe six o’clock?  When them long arm catch them place, and them short arm catch them place, you call me in the morning time.”  Exit from saloon - silence - then: “You sabe five o’clock?  When them long arm catch them place, and them short arm catch them place, you call me in the morning time.”  Exit - silence - then: “You sabe half-past five o’clock?  When them long arm - ”  Oh, if I were a watchman!  Anyhow, that five o’clocker will have the whole ship’s company roused in the morning time.</p>
<p><i>June 7th</i>. - Every one called in the morning time by the reflex row from the rousing of the five o’clocker.  Glorious morning.  The scene the reversal of that of last night.  The forest to the east shows a deep blue-purple, mounted on a background that changes as you watch it from daffodil and amethyst to rose-pink, as the sun comes up through the night mists.  The moon sinks down among them, her pale face flushing crimson as she goes; and the yellow-gold sunshine comes, glorifying the forest and gilding the great sweep of tufted papyrus growing alongside the bank; and the mist vanishes, little white flecks of it lingering among the water reeds and lying in the dark shadows of the forest stems.  The air is full of the long, soft, rich notes of the plantain warblers, and the uproar consequent upon the <i>Mové</i> taking on fuel wood, which comes alongside in canoe loads from the <i>Fallaba</i>.</p>
<p>Père Steinitz and Mr. Woods are busy preparing their respective canoes for their run to Fernan Vaz through the creek.  Their canoes are very fine ones, with a remarkably clean run aft.  The Père’s is quite the travelling canoe, with a little stage of bamboo aft, covered with a hood of palm thatch, under which you can make yourself quite comfortable, and keep yourself and your possessions dry, unless something desperate comes on in the way of rain.</p>
<p>By 10.25 we have got all our wood aboard, and run off up river full speed.  The river seems broader above the <i>Fallaba</i>, but this is mainly on account of its being temporarily unencumbered with islands.  A good deal of the bank we have passed by since leaving Nazareth Bay on the south side has been island shore, with a channel between the islands and the true south bank.</p>
<p>The day soon grew dull, and looked threatening, after the delusive manner of the dry season.  The climbing plants are finer here than I have ever before seen them.  They form great veils and curtains between and over the trees, often hanging so straight and flat, in stretches of twenty to forty feet or so wide, and thirty to sixty or seventy feet high, that it seems incredible that no human hand has trained or clipped them into their perfect forms.  Sometimes these curtains are decorated with large bell-shaped, bright-coloured flowers, sometimes with delicate sprays of white blossoms.  This forest is beyond all my expectations of tropical luxuriance and beauty, and it is a thing of another world to the forest of the Upper Calabar, which, beautiful as it is, is a sad dowdy to this.  There you certainly get a great sense of grimness and vastness; here you have an equal grimness and vastness with the addition of superb colour.  This forest is a Cleopatra to which Calabar is but a Quaker.  Not only does this forest depend on flowers for its illumination, for there are many kinds of trees having their young shoots, crimson, brown-pink, and creamy yellow: added to this there is also the relieving aspect of the prevailing fashion among West African trees, of wearing the trunk white with here and there upon it splashes of pale pink lichen, and vermilion-red fungus, which alone is sufficient to prevent the great mass of vegetation from being a monotony in green.</p>
<p>All day long we steam past ever-varying scenes of loveliness whose component parts are ever the same, yet the effect ever different.  Doubtless it is wrong to call it a symphony, yet I know no other word to describe the scenery of the Ogowé.  It is as full of life and beauty and passion as any symphony Beethoven ever wrote: the parts changing, interweaving, and returning.  There are <i>leit motifs</i> here in it, too.  See the papyrus ahead; and you know when you get abreast of it you will find the great forest sweeping away in a bay-like curve behind it against the dull gray sky, the splendid columns of its cotton and red woods looking like a façade of some limitless inchoate temple.  Then again there is that stretch of sword-grass, looking as if it grew firmly on to the bottom, so steady does it stand; but as the <i>Mové</i> goes by, her wash sets it undulating in waves across its broad acres of extent, showing it is only riding at anchor; and you know after a grass patch you will soon see a red dwarf clay cliff, with a village perched on its top, and the inhabitants thereof in their blue and red cloths standing by to shout and wave to the <i>Mové</i>, or legging it like lamp-lighters from the back streets and the plantation to the river frontage, to be in time to do so, and through all these changing phases there is always the strain of the vast wild forest, and the swift, deep, silent river.</p>
<p>At almost every village that we pass - and they are frequent after the <i>Fallaba</i> - there is an ostentatious display of firewood deposited either on the bank, or on piles driven into the mud in front of it, mutely saying in their uncivilised way, “Try our noted chunks: best value for money” - (that is to say, tobacco, etc.), to the <i>Mové</i> or any other little steamer that may happen to come along hungry for fuel.</p>
<p>We stayed a few minutes this afternoon at Ashchyouka, where there came off to us in a canoe an enterprising young Frenchman who has planted and tended a coffee plantation in this out-of-the-way region, and which is now, I am glad to hear, just coming into bearing.  After leaving Ashchyouka, high land showed to the N.E., and at 5.15, without evident cause to the uninitiated, the <i>Mové</i> took to whistling like a liner.  A few minutes later a factory shows up on the hilly north bank, which is Woermann’s; then just beyond and behind it we see the Government Post; then Hatton and Cookson’s factory, all in a line.  Opposite Hatton and Cookson’s there was a pretty little stern-wheel steamer nestling against the steep clay bank of Lembarene Island when we come in sight, but she instantly swept out from it in a perfect curve, which lay behind her marked in frosted silver on the water as she dropt down river.  I hear now she was the <i>Éclaireur</i>, the stern-wheeler which runs up and down the Ogowé in connection with the Chargeurs Réunis Company, subsidised by the Government, and when the <i>Mové</i> whistled, she was just completing taking on 3,000 billets of wood for fuel.  She comes up from the Cape (Lopez) stoking half wood and half coal as far as Njole and back to Lembarene; from Lembarene to the sea downwards she does on wood.  In a few minutes we have taken her berth close to the bank, and tied up to a tree.  The white engineer yells to the black engineer “Tom-Tom: Haul out some of them fire and open them drains one time,” and the stokers, with hooks, pull out the glowing logs on to the iron deck in front of the furnace door, and throw water over them, and the <i>Mové</i> sends a cloud of oil-laden steam against the bank, coming perilously near scalding some of her black admirers assembled there.  I dare say she felt vicious because they had been admiring the <i>Éclaireur</i>.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, I am escorted on to the broad verandah of Hatton and Cookson’s factory, and I sit down under a lamp, prepared to contemplate, until dinner time, the wild beauty of the scene.  This idea does not get carried out; in the twinkling of an eye I am stung all round the neck, and recognise there are lots too many mosquitoes and sandflies in the scenery to permit of contemplation of any kind.  Never have I seen sandflies and mosquitoes in such appalling quantities.  With a wild ping of joy the latter made for me, and I retired promptly into a dark corner of the verandah, swearing horribly, but internally, and fought them.  Mr. Hudson, Agent-general, and Mr. Cockshut, Agent for the Ogowé, walk up and down the beach in front, doubtless talking cargo, apparently unconscious of mosquitoes; but by and by, while we are having dinner, they get their share.  I behave exquisitely, and am quite lost in admiration of my own conduct, and busily deciding in my own mind whether I shall wear one of those plain ring haloes, or a solid plate one, <i>à la</i> Cimabue, when Mr. Hudson says in a voice full of reproach to Mr. Cockshut, “You have got mosquitoes here, Mr. Cockshut.”  Poor Mr. Cockshut doesn’t deny it; he has got four on his forehead and his hands are sprinkled with them, but he says: “There are none at Njole,” which we all feel is an absurdly lame excuse, for Njole is some ninety miles above Lembarene, where we now are.  Mr. Hudson says this to him, tersely, and feeling he has utterly crushed Mr. Cockshut, turns on me, and utterly failing to recognise me as a suffering saint, says point blank and savagely, “You don’t seem to feel these things, Miss Kingsley.”  Not feel them, indeed!  Why, I could cry over them.  Well! that’s all the thanks one gets for trying not to be a nuisance in this world.</p>
<p>After dinner I go back on to the <i>Mové</i> for the night, for it is too late to go round to Kangwe and ask Mme. Jacot, of the Mission Evangelique, if she will take me in.  The air is stiff with mosquitoes, and saying a few suitable words to them, I dash under the mosquito bar and sleep, lulled by their shrill yells of baffled rage.</p>
<p><i>June 8th</i>. - In the morning, up at five.  Great activity on beach.  <i>Mové</i> synchronously taking on wood fuel and discharging cargo.  A very active young French pastor from the Kangwe mission station is round after the mission’s cargo.  Mr. Hudson kindly makes inquiries as to whether I may go round to Kangwe and stay with Mme. Jacot.  He says: “Oh, yes,” but as I find he is not M. Jacot, I do not feel justified in accepting this statement without its having personal confirmation from Mme. Jacot, and so, leaving my luggage with the <i>Mové</i>, I get them to allow me to go round with him and his cargo to Kangwe, about three-quarters of an hour’s paddle round the upper part of Lembarene Island, and down the broad channel on the other side of it.  Kangwe is beautifully situated on a hill, as its name denotes, on the mainland and north bank of the river.  Mme. Jacot most kindly says I may come, though I know I shall be a fearful nuisance, for there is no room for me save M. Jacot’s beautifully neat, clean, tidy study.  I go back in the canoe and fetch my luggage from the <i>Mové</i>; and say good-bye to Mr. Hudson, who gave me an immense amount of valuable advice about things, which was subsequently of great use to me, and a lot of equally good warnings which, if I had attended to, would have enabled me to avoid many, if not all, my misadventures in Congo Français.</p>
<p>I camped out that night in M. Jacot’s study, wondering how he would like it when he came home and found me there; for he was now away on one of his usual evangelising tours.  Providentially Mme. Jacot let me have the room that the girls belonging to the mission school usually slept in, to my great relief, before M. Jacot came home.</p>
<p>I will not weary you with my diary during my first stay at Kangwe.  It is a catalogue of the collection of fish, etc., that I made, and a record of the continuous, never-failing kindness and help that I received from M. and Mme. Jacot, and of my attempts to learn from them the peculiarities of the region, the natives, and their language and customs, which they both know so well and manage so admirably.  I daily saw there what it is possible to do, even in the wildest and most remote regions of West Africa, and recognised that there is still one heroic form of human being whose praise has never adequately been sung, namely, the missionary’s wife.</p>
<p>Wishing to get higher up the Ogowé, I took the opportunity of the river boat of the Chargeurs Réunis going up to the Njole on one of her trips, and joined her.</p>
<p><i>June 22nd</i>. - <i>Éclaireur</i>, charming little stern wheel steamer, exquisitely kept.  She has an upper and a lower deck.  The lower deck for business, the upper deck for white passengers only.  On the upper deck there is a fine long deck-house, running almost her whole length.  In this are the officers’ cabins, the saloon and the passengers’ cabins (two), both large and beautifully fitted up.  Captain Verdier exceedingly pleasant and constantly saying “N’est-ce pas?”  A quiet and singularly clean engineer completes the white staff.</p>
<p>The passengers consist of Mr. Cockshut, going up river to see after the sub-factories; a French official bound for Franceville, which it will take him thirty-six days, go as quick as he can, in a canoe after Njole; a tremendously lively person who has had black water fever four times, while away in the bush with nothing to live on but manioc, a diet it would be far easier to die on under the circumstances.  He is excellent company; though I do not know a word he says, he is perpetually giving lively and dramatic descriptions of things which I cannot but recognise.  M. S---, with his pince-nez, the Doctor, and, above all, the rapids of the Ogowé, rolling his hands round and round each other and clashing them forward with a descriptive ejaculation of “Whish, flash, bum, bum, bump,” and then comes what evidently represents a terrific fight for life against terrific odds.  Wish to goodness I knew French, for wishing to see these rapids, I cannot help feeling anxious and worried at not fully understanding this dramatic entertainment regarding them.  There is another passenger, said to be the engineer’s brother, a quiet, gentlemanly man.  Captain argues violently with every one; with Mr. Cockshut on the subject of the wicked waste of money in keeping the <i>Mové</i> and not shipping all goods by the <i>Éclaireur</i>, “N’est-ce pas?” and with the French official on goodness knows what, but I fancy it will be pistols for two and coffee for one in the morning time.  When the captain feels himself being worsted in argument, he shouts for support to the engineer and his brother.  “N’est-ce pas?” he says, turning furiously to them.  “Oui, oui, certainement,” they say dutifully and calmly, and then he, refreshed by their support, dashes back to his controversial fray.  He even tries to get up a row with me on the subject of the English merchants at Calabar, whom he asserts have sworn a kind of blood oath to ship by none but British and African Company’s steamers.  I cannot stand this, for I know my esteemed and honoured friends the Calabar traders would ship by the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> or the Devil himself if either of them would take the stuff at 15 shillings the ton.  We have, however, to leave off this row for want of language, to our mutual regret, for it would have been a love of a fight.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving Lembarene Island, we pass the mouth of the chief southern affluent of the Ogowé, the Ngunie; it flows in unostentatiously from the E.S.E., a broad, quiet river here with low banks and two islands (Walker’s Islands) showing just off its entrance.  Higher up, it flows through a mountainous country, and at Samba, its furthest navigable point, there is a wonderfully beautiful waterfall, the whole river coming down over a low cliff, surrounded by an amphitheatre of mountains.  It takes the <i>Éclaireur</i> two days steaming from the mouth of the Ngunie to Samba, when she can get up; but now, in the height of the long dry season neither she nor the <i>Mové</i> can go because of the sandbanks; so Samba is cut off until next October.  Hatton and Cookson have factories up at Samba, for it is an outlet for the trade of Achango land in rubber and ivory, a trade worked by the Akele tribe, a powerful, savage and difficult lot to deal with, and just in the same condition, as far as I can learn, as they were when Du Chaillu made his wonderful journeys among them.  While I was at Lembarene, waiting for the <i>Éclaireur</i>, a notorious chief descended on a Ngunie sub-factory, and looted it.  The wife of the black trading agent made a gallant resistance, her husband was away on a trading expedition, but the chief had her seized and beaten, and thrown into the river.  An appeal was made to the Doctor then Administrator of the Ogowé, a powerful and helpful official, and he soon came up with the little canoniere, taking Mr. Cockshut with him and fully vindicated the honour of the French flag, under which all factories here are.</p>
<p>The banks of the Ogowé just above Lembarene Island are low; with the forest only broken by village clearings and seeming to press in on those, ready to absorb them should the inhabitants cease their war against it.  The blue Ntyankâlâ mountains of Achango land show away to the E.S.E. in a range.  Behind us, gradually sinking in the distance, is the high land on Lembarene Island.</p>
<p>Soon we run up alongside a big street of a village with four high houses rising a story above the rest, which are strictly ground floor; it has also five or six little low open thatched huts along the street in front. <a id="citation96"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote96" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{96}</a>  These may be fetish huts, or, as the captain of the <i>Sparrow</i> would say, “again they mayn’t.”  For I have seen similar huts in the villages round Libreville, which were store places for roof mats, of which the natives carefully keep a store dry and ready for emergencies in the way of tornadoes, or to sell.  We stop abreast of this village.  Inhabitants in scores rush out and form an excited row along the vertical bank edge, several of the more excited individuals falling over it into the water.</p>
<p>Yells from our passengers on the lower deck.  Yells from inhabitants on shore.  Yells of <i>vite, vite</i> from the Captain.  Dogs bark, horns bray, some exhilarated individual thumps the village drum, canoes fly out from the bank towards us.  Fearful scrimmage heard going on all the time on the deck below.  As soon as the canoes are alongside, our passengers from the lower deck, with their bundles and their dogs, pour over the side into them.  Canoes rock wildly and wobble off rapidly towards the bank, frightening the passengers because they have got their best clothes on, and fear that the <i>Éclaireur</i> will start and upset them altogether with her wash.</p>
<p>On reaching the bank, the new arrivals disappear into brown clouds of wives and relations, and the dogs into fighting clusters of resident dogs.  Happy, happy day!  For those men who have gone ashore have been away on hire to the government and factories for a year, and are safe home in the bosoms of their families again, and not only they themselves, but all the goods they have got in pay.  The remaining passengers below still yell to their departed friends; I know not what they say, but I expect it’s the Fan equivalent for “Mind you write.  Take care of yourself.  Yes, I’ll come and see you soon,” etc., etc.  While all this is going on, the <i>Éclaireur</i> quietly slides down river, with the current, broadside on as if she smelt her stable at Lembarene.  This I find is her constant habit whenever the captain, the engineer, and the man at the wheel are all busy in a row along the rail, shouting overside, which occurs whenever we have passengers to land.  Her iniquity being detected when the last canoe load has left for the shore, she is spun round and sent up river again at full speed.</p>
<p>We go on up stream; now and again stopping at little villages to land passengers or at little sub-factories to discharge cargo, until evening closes in, when we anchor and tie up at O’Saomokita, where there is a sub-factory of Messrs. Woermann’s, in charge of which is a white man, the only white man between Lembarene and Njole.  He comes on board and looks only a boy, but is really aged twenty.  He is a Frenchman, and was at Hatton and Cookson’s first, then he joined Woermann’s, who have put him in charge of this place.  The isolation for a white man must be terrible; sometimes two months will go by without his seeing another white face but that in his looking-glass, and when he does see another, it is only by a fleeting visit such as we now pay him, and to make the most of this, he stays on board to dinner.</p>
<p><i>June 23rd</i>. - Start off steaming up river early in the morning time.  Land ahead showing mountainous.  Rather suddenly the banks grow higher.  Here and there in the forest are patches which look like regular hand-made plantations, which they are not, but only patches of egombie-gombie trees, showing that at this place was once a native town.  Whenever land is cleared along here, this tree springs up all over the ground.  It grows very rapidly, and has great leaves something like a sycamore leaf, only much larger.  These leaves growing in a cluster at the top of the straight stem give an umbrella-like appearance to the affair; so the natives call them and an umbrella by the same name, but whether they think the umbrella is like the tree or the tree is like the umbrella, I can’t make out.  I am always getting myself mixed over this kind of thing in my attempts “to contemplate phenomena from a scientific standpoint,” as Cambridge ordered me to do.  I’ll give the habit up.  “You can’t do that sort of thing out here - It’s the climate,” and I will content myself with stating the fact, that when a native comes into a store and wants an umbrella, he asks for an egombie-gombie.</p>
<p>The uniformity of the height of the individual trees in one of these patches is striking, and it arises from their all starting fair.  I cannot make out other things about them to my satisfaction, for you very rarely see one of them in the wild bush, and then it does not bear a fruit that the natives collect and use, and then chuck away the stones round their domicile.  Anyhow, there they are all one height, and all one colour, and apparently allowing no other vegetation to make any headway among them.  But I found when I carefully investigated egombie-gombie patches that there were a few of the great, slower-growing forest trees coming up amongst them, and in time when these attain a sufficient height, their shade kills off the egombie-gombie, and the patch goes back into the great forest from which it came.  The frequency of these patches arises from the nomadic habits of the chief tribe in these regions, the Fans.  They rarely occupy one site for a village for any considerable time on account - firstly, of their wasteful method of collecting rubber by cutting down the vine, which soon stamps it out of a district; and, secondly, from their quarrelsome ways.  So when a village of Fans has cleared all the rubber out of its district, or has made the said district too hot to hold it by rows with other villages, or has got itself very properly shelled out and burnt for some attack on traders or the French flag in any form, its inhabitants clear off into another district, and build another village; for bark and palm thatch are cheap, and house removing just nothing; when you are an unsophisticated cannibal Fan you don’t require a pantechnicon van to stow away your one or two mushroom-shaped stools, knives, and cooking-pots, and a calabash or so.  If you are rich, maybe you will have a box with clothes in as well, but as a general rule all your clothes are on your back.  So your wives just pick up the stools and the knives and the cooking-pots, and the box, and the children toddle off with the calabashes.  You have, of course, the gun to carry, for sleeping or waking a Fan never parts with his gun, and so there you are “finish,” as M. Pichault would say, and before your new bark house is up, there grows the egombie-gombie, where your house once stood.  Now and again, for lack of immediate neighbouring villages to quarrel with, one end of a village will quarrel with the other end.  The weaker end then goes off and builds itself another village, keeping an eye lifting for any member of the stronger end who may come conveniently into its neighbourhood to be killed and eaten.  Meanwhile, the egombie-gombie grows over the houses of the empty end, pretending it’s a plantation belonging to the remaining half.  I once heard a new-comer hold forth eloquently as to how those Fans were maligned.  “They say,” said he, with a fine wave of his arm towards such a patch, “that these people do not till the soil - that they are not industrious - that the few plantations they do make are ill-kept - that they are only a set of wandering hunters and cannibals.  Look there at those magnificent plantations!”  I did look, but I did not alter my opinion of the Fans, for I know my old friend egombie-gombie when I see him.</p>
<p>This morning the French official seems sad and melancholy.  I fancy he has got a Monday head (Kipling), but he revives as the day goes on.  As we go on, the banks become hills and the broad river, which has been showing sheets of sandbanks in all directions, now narrows and shows only neat little beaches of white sand in shallow places along the bank.  The current is terrific.  The <i>Éclaireur</i> breathes hard, and has all she can do to fight her way up against it.  Masses of black weathered rock in great boulders show along the exposed parts of both banks, left dry by the falling waters.  Each bank is steep, and quantities of great trees, naked and bare, are hanging down from them, held by their roots and bush-rope entanglement from being swept away with the rushing current, and they make a great white fringe to the banks.  The hills become higher and higher, and more and more abrupt, and the river runs between them in a gloomy ravine, winding to and fro; we catch sight of a patch of white sand ahead, which I mistake for a white painted house, but immediately after doubling round a bend we see the houses of the Talagouga Mission Station.  The <i>Éclaireur</i> forthwith has an hysteric fit on her whistle, so as to frighten M. Forget and get him to dash off in his canoe to her at once.  Apparently he knows her, and does not hurry, but comes on board quietly.  I find there will be no place for me to stay at at Njole, so I decide to go on in the <i>Éclaireur</i> and use her as an hotel while there, and then return and stay with Mme. Forget if she will have me.  I consult M. Forget on this point.  He says, “Oh, yes,” but seems to have lost something of great value recently, and not to be quite clear where.  Only manner, I suppose.  When M. Forget has got his mails he goes, and the <i>Éclaireur</i> goes on; indeed, she has never really stopped, for the water is too deep to anchor in here, and the terrific current would promptly whisk the steamer down out of Talagouga gorge were she to leave off fighting it.  We run on up past Talagouga Island, where the river broadens out again a little, but not much, and reach Njole by nightfall, and tie up to a tree by Dumas’ factory beach.  Usual uproar, but as Mr. Cockshut says, no mosquitoes.  The mosquito belt ends abruptly at O’Soamokita.</p>
<p>Next morning I go ashore and start on a walk.  Lovely road, bright yellow clay, as hard as paving stone.  On each side it is most neatly hedged with pine-apples; behind these, carefully tended, acres of coffee bushes planted in long rows.  Certainly coffee is one of the most lovely of crops.  Its grandly shaped leaves are like those of our medlar tree, only darker and richer green, the berries set close to the stem, those that are ripe, a rich crimson; these trees, I think, are about three years old, and just coming into bearing; for they are covered with full-sized berries, and there has been a flush of bloom on them this morning, and the delicious fragrance of their stephanotis-shaped and scented flowers lingers in the air.  The country spreads before me a lovely valley encompassed by purple-blue mountains.  Mount Talagouga looks splendid in a soft, infinitely deep blue, although it is quite close, just the other side of the river.  The road goes on into the valley, as pleasantly as ever and more so.  How pleasant it would be now, if our government along the Coast had the enterprise and public spirit of the French, and made such roads just on the remote chance of stray travellers dropping in on a steamer once in ten years or so and wanting a walk.  Observe extremely neatly Igalwa built huts, people sitting on the bright clean ground outside them, making mats and baskets.  “Mboloani,” say I.  “Ai! Mbolo,” say they, and knock off work to stare.  Observe large wired-in enclosures on left-hand side of road - investigate - find they are tenanted by animals - goats, sheep, chickens, etc.  Clearly this is a <i>jardin d’acclimatation</i>.  No wonder the colony does not pay, if it goes in for this sort of thing, 206 miles inland, with simply no public to pay gate-money.  While contemplating these things, hear awful hiss.  Serpents!  No, geese.  Awful fight.  Grand things, good, old-fashioned, long skirts are for Africa!  Get through geese and advance in good order, but somewhat rapidly down road, turn sharply round corner of native houses.  Turkey cock - terrific turn up.  Flight on my part forwards down road, which is still going strong, now in a northerly direction, apparently indefinitely.  Hope to goodness there will be a turning that I can go down and get back by, without returning through this ferocious farmyard.  Intent on picking up such an outlet, I go thirty yards or so down the road.  Hear shouts coming from a clump of bananas on my left.  Know they are directed at me, but it does not do to attend to shouts always.  Expect it is only some native with an awful knowledge of English, anxious to get up my family history - therefore accelerate pace.  More shouts, and louder, of “Madame Gacon!  Madame Gacon!” and out of the banana clump comes a big, plump, pleasant-looking gentleman, clad in a singlet and a divided skirt.  White people must be attended to, so advance carefully towards him through a plantation of young coffee, apologising humbly for intruding on his domain.  He smiles and bows beautifully, but - horror! - he knows no English, I no French.  Situation <i>très inexplicable et très interessante</i>, as I subsequently heard him remark; and the worst of it is he is evidently bursting to know who I am, and what I am doing in the middle of his coffee plantation, for his it clearly is, as appears from his obsequious bodyguard of blacks, highly interested in me also.  We gaze at each other, and smile some more, but stiffly, and he stands bareheaded in the sun in an awful way.  It’s murder I’m committing, hard all!  He, as is fitting for his superior sex, displays intelligence first and says, “Interpreter,” waving his hand to the south.  I say “Yes,” in my best Fan, an enthusiastic, intelligent grunt which any one must understand.  He leads the way back towards those geese - perhaps, by the by, that is why he wears those divided skirts - and we enter a beautifully neatly built bamboo house, and sit down opposite to each other at a table and wait for the interpreter who is being fetched.  The house is low on the ground and of native construction, but most beautifully kept, and arranged with an air of artistic feeling quite as unexpected as the rest of my surroundings.  I notice upon the walls sets of pictures of terrific incidents in Algerian campaigns, and a copy of that superb head of M. de Brazza in Arab headgear.  Soon the black minions who have been sent to find one of the plantation hands who is supposed to know French and English, return with the “interpreter.”  That young man is a fraud.  He does not know English - not even coast English - and all he has got under his precious wool is an abysmal ignorance darkened by terror; and so, after one or two futile attempts and some frantic scratching at both those regions which an African seems to regard as the seats of intellectual inspiration, he bolts out of the door.  <i>Situation terrible</i>!  My host and I smile wildly at each other, and both wonder in our respective languages what, in the words of Mr. Squeers as mentioned in the classics - we “shall do in this ’ere most awful go.”  We are both going mad with the strain of the situation, when in walks the engineer’s brother from the <i>Éclaireur</i>.  He seems intensely surprised to find me sitting in his friend the planter’s parlour after my grim and retiring conduct on the <i>Éclaireur</i> on my voyage up.  But the planter tells him all, sousing him in torrents of words, full of the violence of an outbreak of pent-up emotion.  I do not understand what he says, but I catch <i>“très inexplicable”</i> and things like that.  The calm brother of the engineer sits down at the table, and I am sure tells the planter something like this: “Calm yourself, my friend, we picked up this curiosity at Lembarene.  It seems quite harmless.”  And then the planter calmed, and mopped a perspiring brow, and so did I, and we smiled more freely, feeling the mental atmosphere had become less tense and cooler.  We both simply beamed on our deliverer, and the planter gave him lots of things to drink.  I had nothing about me except a head of tobacco in my pocket, which I did not feel was a suitable offering.  Now the engineer’s brother, although he would not own to it, knew English, so I told him how the beauty of the road had lured me on, and how I was interested in coffee-planting, and how much I admired the magnificence of this plantation, and all the enterprise and energy it represented.</p>
<p><i>“Oui, oui, certainement,”</i> said he, and translated.  My friend the planter seemed charmed; it was the first sign of anything approaching reason he had seen in me.  He wanted me to have <i>eau sucrée</i> more kindly than ever, and when I rose, intending to bow myself off and go, geese or no geese, back to the <i>Éclaireur</i>, he would not let me go.  I must see the plantation, <i>toute la plantation</i>.  So presently all three of us go out and thoroughly do the plantation, the most well-ordered, well-cultivated plantation I have ever seen, and a very noble monument to the knowledge and industry of the planter.  For two hot hours these two perfect gentlemen showed me over it.  I also behaved well, for petticoats, great as they are, do not prevent insects and catawumpuses of sorts walking up one’s ankles and feeding on one as one stands on the long grass which has been most wisely cut and laid round the young trees for mulching.  This plantation is of great extent on the hill-sides and in the valley bottom, portions of it are just coming into bearing.  The whole is kept as perfectly as a garden, amazing as the work of one white man with only a staff of unskilled native labourers - at present only eighty of them.  The coffee planted is of three kinds, the Elephant berry, the Arabian, and the San Thomé.  During our inspection, we only had one serious misunderstanding, which arose from my seeing for the first time in my life tree-ferns growing in the Ogowé.  There were three of them, evidently carefully taken care of, among some coffee plants.  It was highly exciting, and I tried to find out about them.  It seemed, even in this centre of enterprise, unlikely that they had been brought just “for dandy” from the Australasian region, and I had never yet come across them in my wanderings save on Fernando Po.  Unfortunately, my friends thought I wanted them to keep, and shouted for men to bring things and dig them up; so I had a brisk little engagement with the men, driving them from their prey with the point of my umbrella, ejaculating Kor Kor, like an agitated crow.  When at last they understood that my interest in the ferns was scientific, not piratical, they called the men off and explained that the ferns had been found among the bush, when it was being cleared for the plantation.</p>
