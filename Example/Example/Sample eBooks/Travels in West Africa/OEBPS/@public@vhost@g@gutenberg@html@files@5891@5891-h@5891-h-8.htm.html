<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br/>
<br/></div>
<p class="c1">Setting forth how the Voyager descends the Rembwé River, with divers excursions and alarms, in the company of a black trader, and returns safely to the Coast.</p>
<p>Getting away from Agonjo seemed as if it would be nearly as difficult as getting to it, but as the quarters were comfortable and the society fairly good, I was not anxious.  I own the local scenery was a little too much of the Niger Delta type for perfect beauty, just the long lines of mangrove, and the muddy river lounging almost imperceptibly to sea, and nothing else in sight.  Mr. Glass, however, did not take things so philosophically.  I was on his commercial conscience, for I had come in from the bush and there was money in me.  Therefore I was a trade product - a new trade stuff that ought to be worked up and developed; and he found himself unable to do this, for although he had secured the first parcel, as it were, and got it successfully stored, yet he could not ship it, and he felt this was a reproach to him.</p>
<p>Many were his lamentations that the firm had not provided him with a large sailing canoe and a suitable crew to deal with this new line of trade.  I did my best to comfort him, pointing out that the most enterprising firm could not be expected to provide expensive things like these, on the extremely remote chance of ladies arriving per bush at Agonjo - in fact not until the trade in them was well developed.  But he refused to see it in this light and harped upon the subject, wrapped up, poor man, in a great coat and a muffler, because his ague was on him.</p>
<p>I next tried to convince Mr. Glass that any canoe would do for me to go down in.  “No,” he said, “any canoe will not do;” and he explained that when you got down the Rembwé to ’Como Point you were in a rough, nasty bit of water, the Gaboon, which has a fine confused set of currents from the tidal wash and the streams of the Rembwé and ’Como rivers, in which it would be improbable that a river canoe could live any time worth mentioning.  Progress below ’Como Point by means of mere paddling he considered impossible.  There was nothing for it but a big sailing canoe, and there was no big sailing canoe to be had.  I think Mr. Glass got a ray of comfort out of the fact that Messrs. John Holt’s sub-agent was, equally with himself, unable to ship me.</p>
<p>At this point in the affair there entered a highly dramatic figure.  He came on to the scene suddenly and with much uproar, in a way that would have made his fortune in a transpontine drama.  I shall always regret I have not got that man’s portrait, for I cannot do him justice with ink.  He dashed up on to the verandah, smote the frail form of Mr. Glass between the shoulders, and flung his own massive one into a chair.  His name was Obanjo, but he liked it pronounced Captain Johnson, and his profession was a bush and river trader on his own account.  Every movement of the man was theatrical, and he used to look covertly at you every now and then to see if he had produced his impression, which was evidently intended to be that of a reckless, rollicking skipper.  There was a Hallo-my-Hearty atmosphere coming off him from the top of his hat to the soles of his feet, like the scent off a flower; but it did not require a genius in judging men to see that behind, and under this was a very different sort of man, and if I should ever want to engage in a wild and awful career up a West African river I shall start on it by engaging Captain Johnson.  He struck me as being one of those men, of whom I know five, whom I could rely on, that if one of them and I went into the utter bush together, one of us at least would come out alive and have made something substantial by the venture; which is a great deal more than I could say, for example, of Ngouta, who was still with me, as he desired to see the glories of Gaboon and buy a hanging lamp.</p>
<p>Captain Johnson’s attire calls for especial comment and admiration.  However disconnected the two sides of his character might be, his clothes bore the impress of both of his natures to perfection.  He wore, when first we met, a huge sombrero hat, a spotless singlet, and a suit of clean, well-got-up dungaree, and an uncommonly picturesque, powerful figure he cut in them, with his finely moulded, well-knit form and good-looking face, full of expression always, but always with the keen small eyes in it watching the effect his genial smiles and hearty laugh produced.  The eyes were the eyes of Obanjo, the rest of the face the property of Captain Johnson.  I do not mean to say that they were the eyes of a bad bold man, but you had not to look twice at them to see they belonged to a man courageous in the African manner, full of energy and resource, keenly intelligent and self-reliant, and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I left him and the refined Mr. Glass together to talk over the palaver of shipping me, and they talked it at great length.  Finally the price I was to pay Obanjo was settled and we proceeded to less important details.  It seemed Obanjo, when up the river this time, had set about constructing a new and large trading canoe at one of his homes, in which he was just thinking of taking his goods down to Gaboon.  Next morning Obanjo with his vessel turned up, and saying farewell to my kind host, Mr. Sanga Glass, I departed.</p>
<p>She had the makings of a fine vessel in her; though roughly hewn out of an immense hard-wood tree: her lines were good, and her type was that of the big sea-canoes of the Bight of Panavia.  Very far forward was a pole mast, roughly made, but European in intention, and carrying a long gaff.  Shrouds and stays it had not, and my impression was that it would be carried away if we dropped in for half a tornado, until I saw our sail and recognised that that would go to darning cotton instantly if it fell in with even a breeze.  It was a bed quilt that had evidently been in the family some years, and although it had been in places carefully patched with pieces of previous sets of the captain’s dungarees, in other places, where it had not, it gave “free passage to the airs of Heaven”; which I may remark does not make for speed in the boat mounting such canvas.  Partly to this sail, partly to the amount of trading affairs we attended to, do I owe the credit of having made a record trip down the Rembwé, the slowest white man time on record.</p>
<p>Fixed across the stern of the canoe there was the usual staging made of bamboos, flush with the gunwale.  Now this sort of staging is an exceedingly good idea when it is fully finished.  You can stuff no end of things under it; and over it there is erected a hood of palm-thatch, giving a very comfortable cabin five or six feet long and about three feet high in the centre, and you can curl yourself up in it and, if you please, have a mat hung across the opening.  But we had not got so far as that yet on our vessel, only just got the staging fixed in fact; and I assure you a bamboo staging is but a precarious perch when in this stage of formation.  I made myself a reclining couch on it in the Roman manner with my various belongings, and was exceeding comfortable until we got nearly out of the Rembwé into the Gaboon.  Then came grand times.  Our noble craft had by this time got a good list on her from our collected cargo - ill stowed.  This made my home, the bamboo staging, about as reposeful a place as the slope of a writing desk would be if well polished; and the rough and choppy sea gave our vessel the most peculiar set of motions imaginable.  She rolled, which made it precarious for things on the bamboo staging, but still a legitimate motion, natural and foreseeable.  In addition to this, she had a cataclysmic kick in her - that I think the heathenish thing meant to be a pitch - which no mortal being could foresee or provide against, and which projected portable property into the waters of the Gaboon over the stern and on to the conglomerate collection in the bottom of the canoe itself, making Obanjo repeat, with ferocity and feeling, words he had heard years ago, when he was boatswain on a steamboat trading on the Coast.  It was fortunate, you will please understand, for my future, that I have usually been on vessels of the British African or the African lines when voyaging about this West African sea-board, as the owners of these vessels prohibit the use of bad language on board, or goodness only knows what words I might not have remembered and used in the Gaboon estuary.</p>
<p>We left Agonjo with as much bustle and shouting and general air of brisk seamanship as Obanjo could impart to the affair, and the hopeful mind might have expected to reach somewhere important by nightfall.  I did not expect that; neither, on the other hand, did I expect that after we had gone a mile and only four, as the early ballad would say, that we should pull up and anchor against a small village for the night; but this we did, the captain going ashore to see for cargo, and to get some more crew.</p>
<p>There were grand times ashore that night, and the captain returned on board about 2 A.M. with some rubber and pissava and two new hands whose appearance fitted them to join our vessel; for a more villainous-looking set than our crew I never laid eye on.  One enormously powerful fellow looked the incarnation of the horrid negro of buccaneer stories, and I admired Obanjo for the way he kept them in hand.  We had now also acquired a small dug-out canoe as tender, and a large fishing-net.  About 4 A.M. in the moonlight we started to drop down river on the tail of the land breeze, and as I observed Obanjo wanted to sleep I offered to steer.  After putting me through an examination in practical seamanship, and passing me, he gladly accepted my offer, handed over the tiller which stuck out across my bamboo staging, and went and curled himself up, falling sound asleep among the crew in less time than it takes to write.  On the other nights we spent on this voyage I had no need to offer to steer; he handed over charge to me as a matter of course, and as I prefer night to day in Africa, I enjoyed it.  Indeed, much as I have enjoyed life in Africa, I do not think I ever enjoyed it to the full as I did on those nights dropping down the Rembwé.  The great, black, winding river with a pathway in its midst of frosted silver where the moonlight struck it: on each side the ink-black mangrove walls, and above them the band of star and moonlit heavens that the walls of mangrove allowed one to see.  Forward rose the form of our sail, idealised from bed-sheetdom to glory; and the little red glow of our cooking fire gave a single note of warm colour to the cold light of the moon.  Three or four times during the second night, while I was steering along by the south bank, I found the mangrove wall thinner, and standing up, looked through the network of their roots and stems on to what seemed like plains, acres upon acres in extent, of polished silver - more specimens of those awful slime lagoons, one of which, before we reached Ndorko, had so very nearly collected me.  I watched them, as we leisurely stole past, with a sort of fascination.  On the second night, towards the dawn, I had the great joy of seeing Mount Okoneto, away to the S.W., first showing moonlit, and then taking the colours of the dawn before they reached us down below.  Ah me! give me a West African river and a canoe for sheer good pleasure.  Drawbacks, you say?  Well, yes, but where are there not drawbacks?  The only drawbacks on those Rembwé nights were the series of horrid frights I got by steering on to tree shadows and thinking they were mud banks, or trees themselves, so black and solid did they seem.  I never roused the watch fortunately, but got her off the shadow gallantly single-handed every time, and called myself a fool instead of getting called one.  My nautical friends carp at me for getting on shadows, but I beg them to consider before they judge me, whether they have ever steered at night down a river quite unknown to them an unhandy canoe, with a bed-sheet sail, by the light of the moon.  And what with my having a theory of my own regarding the proper way to take a vessel round a corner, and what with having to keep the wind in the bed-sheet where the bed-sheet would hold it, it’s a wonder to me I did not cast that vessel away, or go and damage Africa.</p>
<p>By daylight the Rembwé scenery was certainly not so lovely, and might be slept through without a pang.  It had monotony, without having enough of it to amount to grandeur.  Every now and again we came to villages, each of which was situated on a heap of clay and sandy soil, presumably the end of a spit of land running out into the mangrove swamp fringing the river.  Every village we saw we went alongside and had a chat with, and tried to look up cargo in the proper way.  One village in particular did we have a lively time at.  Obanjo had a wife and home there, likewise a large herd of goats, some of which he was desirous of taking down with us to sell at Gaboon.  It was a pleasant-looking village, with a clean yellow beach which most of the houses faced.  But it had ramifications in the interior.  I being very lazy, did not go ashore, but watched the pantomime from the bamboo staging.  The whole flock of goats enter at right end of stage, and tear violently across the scene, disappearing at left.  Two minutes elapse.  Obanjo and his gallant crew enter at right hand of stage, leg it like lamplighters across front, and disappear at left.  Fearful pow-wow behind the scenes.  Five minutes elapse.  Enter goats at right as before, followed by Obanjo and company as before, and so on <i>da capo</i>.  It was more like a fight I once saw between the armies of Macbeth and Macduff than anything I have seen before or since; only our Rembwé play was better put on, more supers, and noise, and all that sort of thing, you know.  It was a spirited performance I assure you and I and the inhabitants of the village, not personally interested in goat-catching, assumed the <i>rôle</i> of audience and cheered it to the echo.</p>
<p>We had another cheerful little incident that afternoon.  While we were going along softly, softly as was our wont, in the broiling heat, I wishing I had an umbrella - for sitting on that bamboo stage with no sort of protection from the sun was hot work after the forest shade I had had previously - two small boys in two small canoes shot out from the bank and paddled hard to us and jumped on board.  After a few minutes’ conversation with Obanjo one of them carefully sank his canoe; the other just turned his adrift and they joined our crew.  I saw they were Fans, as indeed nearly all the crew were, but I did not think much of the affair.  Our tender, the small canoe, had been sent out as usual with the big black man and another A. B. to fish; it being one of our industries to fish hard all the time with that big net.  The fish caught, sometimes a bushel or two at a time, almost all grey mullet, were then brought alongside, split open, and cleaned.  We then had all round as many of them for supper as we wanted, the rest we hung on strings over our fire, more or less insufficiently smoking them to prevent decomposition, it being Obanjo’s intention to sell them when he made his next trip up the ’Como; for the latter being less rich in fish than the Rembwé they would command a good price there.  We always had our eye on things like this, being, I proudly remark, none of your gilded floating hotel of a ferry-boat like those Cunard or White Star liners are, but just a good trader that was not ashamed to pay, and not afraid of work.</p>
<p>Well, just after we had leisurely entered a new reach of the river, round the corner after us, propelled at a phenomenal pace, came our fishing canoe, which we had left behind to haul in the net and then rejoin us.  The occupants, particularly the big black A. B., were shouting something in terror stricken accents.  “What?” says Obanjo springing to his feet.  “The Fan! the Fan!” shouted the canoe men as they shot towards us like agitated chickens making for their hen.  In another moment they were alongside and tumbling over our gunwale into the bottom of the vessel still crying “The Fan!  The Fan!  The Fan!”  Obanjo then by means of energetic questioning externally applied, and accompanied by florid language that cast a rose pink glow smelling of sulphur, round us, elicited the information that about 40,000 Fans, armed with knives and guns, were coming down the Rembwé with intent to kill and slay us, and might be expected to arrive within the next half wink.  On hearing this, the whole of our gallant crew took up masterly recumbent positions in the bottom of our vessel and turned gray round the lips.  But Obanjo rose to the situation like ten lions.  “Take the rudder,” he shouted to me, “take her into the middle of the stream and keep the sail full.”  It occurred to me that perhaps a position underneath the bamboo staging might be more healthy than one on the top of it, exposed to every microbe of a bit of old iron and what not and a half that according to native testimony would shortly be frisking through the atmosphere from those Fan guns; and moreover I had not forgotten having been previously shot in a somewhat similar situation, though in better company.  However I did not say anything; neither, between ourselves, did I somehow believe in those Fans.  So regardless of danger, I grasped the helm, and sent our gallant craft flying before the breeze down the bosom of the great wild river (that’s the proper way to put it, but in the interests of science it may be translated into crawling towards the middle).  Meanwhile Obanjo performed prodigies of valour all over the place.  He triced up the mainsail, stirred up his fainthearted crew, and got out the sweeps, <i>i.e</i>. one old oar and four paddles, and with this assistance we solemnly trudged away from danger at a pace that nothing slower than a Thames dumb barge, going against stream, could possibly overhaul.  Still we did not feel safe, and I suggested to Ngouta he should rise up and help; but he declined, stating he was a married man.  Obanjo cheering the paddlers with inspiriting words sprang with the agility of a leopard on to the bamboo staging aft, standing there with his gun ready loaded and cocked to face the coming foe, looking like a statue put up to himself at the public expense.  The worst of this was, however, that while Obanjo’s face was to the coming foe, his back was to the crew, and they forthwith commenced to re-subside into the bottom of the boat, paddles and all.  I, as second in command, on seeing this, said a few blood-stirring words to them, and Obanjo sent a few more of great power at them over his shoulder, and so we kept the paddles going.</p>
<p>Presently from round the corner shot a Fan canoe.  It contained a lady in the bows, weeping and wringing her hands, while another lady sympathetically howling, paddled it.  Obanjo in lurid language requested to be informed why they were following us.  The lady in the bows said, “My son! my son!” and in a second more three other canoes shot round the corner full of men with guns.  Now this looked like business, so Obanjo and I looked round to urge our crew to greater exertions and saw, to our disgust, that the gallant band had successfully subsided into the bottom of the boat while we had been eyeing the foe.  Obanjo gave me a recipe for getting the sweeps out again.  I did not follow it, but got the job done, for Obanjo could not take his eye and gun off the leading canoe and the canoes having crept up to within some twenty yards of us, poured out their simple tale of woe.</p>
<p>It seemed that one of those miscreant boys was a runaway from a Fan village.  He had been desirous, with the usual enterprise of young Fans, of seeing the great world that he knew lay down at the mouth of the river, <i>i.e</i>. Libreville Gaboon.  He had pleaded with his parents for leave to go down and engage in work there, but the said parents holding the tenderness of his youth unfitted to combat with Coast Town life and temptation, refused this request, and so the young rascal had run away without leave and with a canoe, and was surmised to have joined the well-known Obanjo.  Obanjo owned he had (more armed canoes were coming round the corner), and said if the mother would come and fetch her boy she could have him.  He for his part would not have dreamed of taking him if he had known his relations disapproved.  Every one seemed much relieved, except the <i>causa belli</i>.  The Fans did not ask about two boys and providentially we gave the lady the right one.  He went reluctantly.  I feel pretty nearly sure he foresaw more kassengo than fatted calf for him on his return home.  When the Fan canoes were well back round the corner again, we had a fine hunt for the other boy, and finally unearthed him from under the bamboo staging.</p>
<p>When we got him out he told the same tale.  He also was a runaway who wanted to see the world, and taking the opportunity of the majority of the people of his village being away hunting, he had slipped off one night in a canoe, and dropped down river to the village of the boy who had just been reclaimed.  The two boys had fraternised, and come on the rest of their way together, lying waiting, hidden up a creek, for Obanjo, who they knew was coming down river; and having successfully got picked up by him, they thought they were safe.  But after this affair boy number two judged there was no more safety yet, and that his family would be down after him very shortly; for he said he was a more valuable and important boy than his late companion, but his family were an uncommon savage set.  We felt not the least anxiety to make their acquaintance, so clapped heels on our gallant craft and kept the paddles going, and as no more Fans were in sight our crew kept at work bravely.  While Obanjo, now in a boisterous state of mind, and flushed with victory, said things to them about the way they had collapsed when those two women in a canoe came round that corner, that must have blistered their feelings, but they never winced.  They laughed at the joke against themselves merrily.  The other boy’s family we never saw and so took him safely to Gaboon, where Obanjo got him a good place.</p>
<p>Really how much danger there was proportionate to the large amount of fear on our boat I cannot tell you.  It never struck me there was any, but on the other hand the crew and Obanjo evidently thought it was a bad place; and my white face would have been no protection, for the Fans would not have suspected a white of being on such a canoe and might have fired on us if they had been unduly irritated and not treated by Obanjo with that fine compound of bully and blarney that he is such a master of.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the true nature of the affair, however, it had one good effect, it got us out of the Rembwé into the Gaboon, and although at the time this seemed a doubtful blessing, it made for progress.  I had by this time mastered the main points of incapability in our craft.  <i>A</i>. we could not go against the wind.  <i>B</i>. we could not go against the tide.  While we were in the Rembwé there was a state we will designate as <i>C</i> - the tide coming one way, the wind another.  With this state we could progress, backwards if the wind came up against us too strong, but seawards if it did not, and the tide was running down.  If the tide was running up, and the wind was coming down, then we went seaward, softly, softly alongside the mangrove bank, where the rip of the tide stream is least.  When, however, we got down off ’Como Point, we met there a state I will designate as <i>D</i> - a fine confused set of marine and fluvial phenomena.  For away to the north the ’Como and Boqué and two other lesser, but considerable streams, were, with the Rembwé, pouring down their waters in swirling, intermingling, interclashing currents; and up against them, to make confusion worse confounded, came the tide, and the tide up the Gaboon is a swift strong thing, and irregular, and has a rise of eight feet at the springs, two-and-a-half at the neaps.  The wind was lulled too, it being evening time.  In this country it is customary for the wind to blow from the land from 8 P.M. until 8 A.M., from the south-west to the east.  Then comes a lull, either an utter dead hot brooding calm, or light baffling winds and draughts that breathe a few panting hot breaths into your sails and die.  Then comes the sea breeze up from the south-south-west or north-west, some days early in the forenoon, some days not till two or three o’clock.  This breeze blows till sundown, and then comes another and a hotter calm.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us we arrived off the head of the Gaboon estuary in this calm, for had we had wind to deal with we should have come to an end.  There were one or two wandering puffs, about the first one of which sickened our counterpane of its ambitious career as a marine sail, so it came away from its gaff and spread itself over the crew, as much as to say, “Here, I’ve had enough of this sailing.  I’ll be a counterpane again.”  We did a great deal of fine varied, spirited navigation, details of which, however, I will not dwell upon because it was successful.  We made one or two circles, taking on water the while and then returned into the south bank backwards.  At that bank we wisely stayed for the night, our meeting with the Gaboon so far having resulted in wrecking our sail, making Ngouta sea-sick and me exasperate; for from our noble vessel having during the course of it demonstrated for the first time her cataclysmic kicking power, I had had a time of it with my belongings on the bamboo stage.  A basket constructed for catching human souls in, given me as a farewell gift by a valued friend, a witch doctor, and in which I kept the few things in life I really cared for, <i>i.e</i>. my brush, comb, tooth brush, and pocket handkerchiefs, went over the stern; while I was recovering this with my fishing line (such was the excellent nature of the thing, I am glad to say it floated) a black bag with my blouses and such essentials went away to leeward.  Obanjo recovered that, but meanwhile my little portmanteau containing my papers and trade tobacco slid off to leeward; and as it also contained geological specimens of the Sierra del Cristal, a massive range of mountains, it must have hopelessly sunk had it not been for the big black, who grabbed it.  All my bedding, six Equetta cloths, given me by Mr. Hamilton in Opobo River before I came South, did get away successfully, but were picked up by means of the fishing line, wet but safe.  After this I did not attempt any more Roman reclining couch luxuries, but stowed all my loose gear under the bamboo staging, and spent the night on the top of the stage, dozing precariously with my head on my knees.</p>
<p>When the morning broke, looking seaward I saw the welcome forms of König (Dambe) and Perroquet (Mbini) Islands away in the distance, looking, as is their wont, like two lumps of cloud that have dropped on to the broad Gaboon, and I felt that I was at last getting near something worth reaching, <i>i.e</i>. Glass, which though still out of sight, I knew lay away to the west of those islands on the northern shore of the estuary.  And if any one had given me the choice of being in Glass within twenty-four hours from the mouth of the Rembwé, or in Paris or London in a week, I would have chosen Glass without a moment’s hesitation.  Much as I dislike West Coast towns as a general rule, there are exceptions, and of all exceptions, the one I like most is undoubtedly Glass Gaboon; and its charms loomed large on that dank chilly morning after a night spent on a bamboo staging in an unfinished native canoe.</p>
<p>The Rembwé, like the ’Como, is said to rise in the Sierra del Cristal.  It is navigable to a place called Isango which is above Agonjo; just above Agonjo it receives an affluent on its southern bank and runs through mountain country, where its course is blocked by rapids for anything but small canoes.  Obanjo did not seem to think this mattered, as there was not much trade up there, and therefore no particular reason why any one should want to go higher up.  Moreover he said the natives were an exceedingly bad lot; but Obanjo usually thinks badly of the bush natives in these regions.  Anyhow they are Fans - and Fans are Fans.  He was anxious for me, however, to start on a trading voyage with him up another river, a notorious river, in the neighbouring Spanish territory.  The idea was I should buy goods at Glass and we should go together and he would buy ivory with them in the interior.  I anxiously inquired where my profits were to come in.  Obanjo who had all the time suspected me of having trade motives, artfully said, “What for you come across from Ogowé?  You say, see this country.  Ah! I say you come with me.  I show you plenty country, plenty men, elephants, leopards, gorillas.  Oh! plenty thing.  Then you say where’s my trade?”  I disclaimed trade motives in a lordly way.  Then says he, “You come with me up there.”  I said I’d see about it later on, for the present I had seen enough men, elephants, gorillas and leopards, and I preferred to go into wild districts under the French flag to any flag.  I am still thinking about taking that voyage, but I’ll not march through Coventry with the crew we had down the Rembwé - that’s flat, as Sir John Falstaff says.  Picture to yourselves, my friends, the charming situation of being up a river surrounded by rapacious savages with a lot of valuable goods in a canoe and with only a crew to defend them possessed of such fighting mettle as our crew had demonstrated themselves to be.  Obanjo might be all right, would be I dare say; but suppose he got shot and you had eighteen stone odd of him thrown on your hands in addition to your other little worries.  There is little doubt such an excursion would be rich in incident and highly interesting, but I am sure it would be, from a commercial point of view, a failure.</p>
<p>Trade has a fascination for me, and going transversely across the nine-mile-broad rough Gaboon estuary in an unfinished canoe with an inefficient counterpane sail has none; but I return duty bound to this unpleasant subject.  We started very early in the morning.  We reached the other side entangled in the trailing garments of the night.  I was thankful during that broiling hot day of one thing, and that was that if Sister Ann was looking out across the river, as was Sister Ann’s invariable way of spending spare moments, Sister Ann would never think I was in a canoe that made such audaciously bad tacks, missed stays, got into irons, and in general behaved in a way that ought to have lost her captain his certificate.  Just as the night came down, however, we reached the northern shore of the Grand Gaboon at Dongila, just off the mouth of the ’Como, still some eleven miles east of König Island, and further still from Glass, but on the same side of the river, which seemed good work.  The foreshore here is very rocky, so we could not go close alongside but anchored out among the rocks.  At this place there is a considerable village and a station of the Roman Catholic Mission.  When we arrived a nun was down on the shore with her school children, who were busy catching shell-fish and generally merry-making.  Obanjo went ashore in the tender, and the holy sister kindly asked me, by him, to come ashore and spend the night; but I was dead tired and felt quite unfit for polite society after the long broiling hot day and getting soaked by water that had washed on board.</p>
<p>We lay off Dongila all night, because of the tide.  I lay off everything, Dongila, canoe and all, a little after midnight.  Obanjo and almost all the crew stayed on shore that night, and I rolled myself up in an Equetta cloth and went sound and happily asleep on the bamboo staging, leaving the canoe pitching slightly.  About midnight some change in the tide, or original sin in the canoe, caused her to softly swing round a bit, and the next news was that I was in the water.  I had long expected this to happen, so was not surprised, but highly disgusted, and climbed on board, needless to say, streaming.  So, in the darkness of the night I got my portmanteau from the hold and thoroughly tidied up.  The next morning we were off early, coasting along to Glass, and safely arriving there, I attempted to look as unconcerned as possible, and vaguely hoped Mr. Hudson would be down in Libreville; for I was nervous about meeting him, knowing that since he had carefully deposited me in safe hands with Mme. Jacot, with many injunctions to be careful, that there were many incidents in my career that would not meet with his approval.  Vain hope! he was on the pier!  He did not approve!  He had heard of most of my goings on.</p>
<p>This however in no way detracts from my great obligation to Mr. Hudson, but adds another item to the great debt of gratitude I owe him; for had it not been for him I should never have seen the interior of this beautiful region of the Ogowé.  I tried to explain to him how much I had enjoyed myself and how I realised I owed it all to him; but he persisted in his opinion that my intentions and ambitions were suicidal, and took me out the ensuing Sunday, as it were on a string.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br/>
<br/></div>
<p class="c1">In which the Voyager attempts cautiously to approach the subject of Fetish, and gives a classification of spirits, and some account of the Ibet and Orunda.</p>
<p>Having given some account of my personal experiences among an African tribe in its original state, <i>i.e</i>. in a state uninfluenced by European ideas and culture, I will make an attempt to give a rough sketch of the African form of thought and the difficulties of studying it, because the study of this thing is my chief motive for going to West Africa.  Since 1893 I have been collecting information in its native state regarding Fetish, and I use the usual terms fetish and ju-ju because they have among us a certain fixed value - a conventional value, but a useful one.  Neither “fetish” nor “ju-ju” are native words.  Fetish comes from the word the old Portuguese explorers used to designate the objects they thought the natives worshipped, and in which they were wise enough to recognise a certain similarity to their own little images and relics of Saints, “<i>Feitiço</i>.”  Ju-ju, on the other hand, is French, and comes from the word for a toy or doll, <a id="citation286"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote286" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{286}</a> so it is not so applicable as the Portuguese name, for the native image is not a doll or toy, and has far more affinity to the image of a saint, inasmuch as it is not venerated for itself, or treasured because of its prettiness, but only because it is the residence, or the occasional haunt, of a spirit.</p>
<p>Stalking the wild West African idea is one of the most charming pursuits in the world.  Quite apart from the intellectual, it has a high sporting interest; for its pursuit is as beset with difficulty and danger as grizzly bear hunting, yet the climate in which you carry on this pursuit - vile as it is - is warm, which to me is almost an essential of existence.  I beg you to understand that I make no pretension to a thorough knowledge of Fetish ideas; I am only on the threshold.  “Ich weiss nicht all doch viel ist mir bekannt,” as Faust said - and, like him after he had said it, I have got a lot to learn.</p>
<p>I do not intend here to weary you with more than a small portion of even my present knowledge, for I have great collections of facts that I keep only to compare with those of other hunters of the wild idea, and which in their present state are valueless to the cabinet ethnologist.  Some of these may be rank lies, some of them mere individual mind-freaks, others have underlying them some idea I am not at present in touch with.</p>
<p>The difficulty of gaining a true conception of the savage’s real idea is great and varied.  In places on the Coast where there is, or has been, much missionary influence the trouble is greatest, for in the first case the natives carefully conceal things they fear will bring them into derision and contempt, although they still keep them in their innermost hearts; and in the second case, you have a set of traditions which are Christian in origin, though frequently altered almost beyond recognition by being kept for years in the atmosphere of the African mind.  For example, there is this beautiful story now extant among the Cabindas.  God made at first all men black - He always does in the African story - and then He went across a great river and called men to follow Him, and the wisest and the bravest and the best plunged into the great river and crossed it; and the water washed them white, so they are the ancestors of the white men.  But the others were afraid too much, and said, “No, we are comfortable here; we have our dances, and our tom-toms, and plenty to eat - we won’t risk it, we’ll stay here”; and they remained in the old place, and from them come the black men.  But to this day the white men come to the bank, on the other side of the river, and call to the black men, saying, “Come, it is better over here.”  I fear there is little doubt that this story is a modified version of some parable preached to the Cabindas at the time the Capuchins had such influence among them, before they were driven out of the lower Congo regions more than a hundred years ago, for political reasons by the Portuguese.</p>
<p>In the bush - where the people have been little, or not at all, in contact with European ideas - in some ways the investigation is easier; yet another set of difficulties confronts you.  The difficulty that seems to occur most easily to people is the difficulty of the language.  The West African languages are not difficult to pick up; nevertheless, there are an awful quantity of them and they are at the best most imperfect mediums of communication.  No one who has been on the Coast can fail to recognise how inferior the native language is to the native’s mind behind it - and the prolixity and repetition he has therefore to employ to make his thoughts understood.</p>
<p>The great comfort is the wide diffusion of that peculiar language, “trade English”; it is not only used as a means of intercommunication between whites and blacks, but between natives using two distinct languages.  On the south-west Coast you find individuals in villages far from the sea, or a trading station, who know it, and this is because they have picked it up and employ it in their dealings with the Coast tribes and travelling traders.  It is by no means an easy language to pick up - it is not a farrago of bad words and broken phrases, but is a definite structure, has a great peculiarity in its verb forms, and employs no genders.  There is no grammar of it out yet; and one of the best ways of learning it is to listen to a seasoned second mate regulating the unloading or loading, of cargo, over the hatch of the hold.  No, my Coast friends, I have <i>not</i> forgotten - but though you did not mean it helpfully, this was one of the best hints you ever gave me.</p>
<p>Another good way is the careful study of examples which display the highest style and the most correct diction; so I append the letter given by Mr. Hutchinson as being about the best bit of trade English I know.</p>
<p>“To Daddy nah Tampin Office, -</p>
<p>Ha Daddy, do, yah, nah beg you tell dem people for me; make dem Sally-own pussin know.  Do yah.  Berrah well.</p>
<p>Ah lib nah Pademba Road - one bwoy lib dah oberside lakah dem two Docter lib overside you Tampin office.  Berrah well.</p>

<p>Do nah beg you yah tell all dem people ’bout dah ting wah dem two bwoy dah blow.  Till am Amtrang Boboh hab febah bad.  Till am titty carn sleep nah night.  Dah nize go kill me two pickin, oh!</p>
<p>           Plabba done.  Good by Daddy.<br/>
                     Crashey Jane.”</p>
<p>Now for the elementary student we will consider this letter.  The complaint in Crashey Jane’s letter is about two boys who are torturing her morning, noon, and night, Sunday and weekday, by blowing some “long long brass ting” as well as a bugle, and the way she dwells on their staying power must bring a sympathetic pang for that black sister into the heart of many a householder in London who lives next to a ladies’ school, or a family of musical tastes.  “One touch of nature,” etc.  “Daddy” is not a term of low familiarity but one of esteem and respect, and the “Tampin Office” is a respectful appellation for the Office of the “New Era” in which this letter was once published.  “Bwoy head big too much,” means that the young man is swelled with conceit because he is connected with “Militie ban.”  “Woh woh” you will find, among all the natives in the Bights, to mean extremely bad.  I think it is native, having some connection with the root Wo - meaning power, etc.; but Mr. Hutchinson may be right, and it may mean “a capacity to bring double woe.”</p>
<p>“Amtrang Boboh” is not the name of some uncivilised savage, as the uninitiated may think; far from it.  It is Bob Armstrong - upside down, and slightly altered, and refers to the Hon. Robert Armstrong, stipendiary magistrate of Sierra Leone, etc.</p>
<p>“Berrah well” is a phrase used whenever the native thinks he has succeeded in putting his statement well.  He sort of turns round and looks at it, says “Berrah well,” in admiration of his own art, and then proceeds.</p>
<p>“Pickin” are children.</p>
<p>“Boney bwoy” is not a local living skeleton, but a native from Bonny River.</p>
<p>“Sally own” is Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>“Blow them head-bone inside” means, blow the top off their heads.</p>
<p>I have a collection of trade English letters and documents, for it is a language that I regard as exceedingly charming, and it really requires study, as you will see by reading Crashey Jane’s epistle without the aid of a dictionary.  It is, moreover, a language that will take you unexpectedly far in Africa, and if you do not understand it, land you in some pretty situations.  One important point that you must remember is that the African is logically right in his answer to such a question as “You have not cleaned this lamp?” - he says, “Yes, sah” - which means, “yes, I have not cleaned the lamp.”  It does not mean a denial to your accusation; he always uses this form, and it is liable to confuse you at first, as are many other of the phrases, such as “I look him, I no see him “; this means “I have been searching for the thing but have not found it”; if he really meant he had looked upon the object but had been unable to get to it, he would say: “I look him, I no catch him,” etc.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the language is, however, far less than the whole set of difficulties with your own mind.  Unless you can make it pliant enough to follow the African idea step by step, however much care you may take, you will not bag your game.  I heard an account the other day of a representative of Her Majesty in Africa who went out for a day’s antelope shooting.  There were plenty of antelope about, and he stalked them with great care; but always, just before he got within shot of the game, they saw something and bolted.  Knowing he and the boy behind him had been making no sound and could not have been seen, he stalked on, but always with the same result; until happening to look round, he saw the boy behind him was supporting the dignity of the Empire at large, and this representative of it in particular, by steadfastly holding aloft the consular flag.  Well, if you go hunting the African idea with the flag of your own religion or opinions floating ostentatiously over you, you will similarly get a very poor bag.</p>
<p>A few hints as to your mental outfit when starting on this sport may be useful.  Before starting for West Africa, burn all your notions about sun-myths and worship of the elemental forces.  My own opinion is you had better also burn the notion, although it is fashionable, that human beings got their first notion of the origin of the soul from dreams.</p>
<p>I went out with my mind full of the deductions of every book on Ethnology, German or English, that I had read during fifteen years - and being a good Cambridge person, I was particularly confident that from Mr. Frazer’s book, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, I had got a semi-universal key to the underlying idea of native custom and belief.  But I soon found this was very far from being the case.  His idea is a true key to a certain quantity of facts, but in West Africa only to a limited quantity.</p>
<p>I do not say, do not read Ethnology - by all means do so; and above all things read, until you know it by heart, <i>Primitive Culture</i>, by Dr. E. B. Tylor, regarding which book I may say that I have never found a fact that flew in the face of the carefully made, broad-minded deductions of this greatest of Ethnologists.  In addition you must know your Westermarck on <i>Human Marriage</i>, and your Waitz <i>Anthropologie</i>, and your Topinard - not that you need expect to go measuring people’s skulls and chests as this last named authority expects you to do, for no self-respecting person black or white likes that sort of thing from the hands of an utter stranger, and if you attempt it you’ll get yourself disliked in West Africa.  Add to this the knowledge of all A. B. Ellis’s works; Burton’s <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>; Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i>; and as much of Aristotle as possible.  If you have a good knowledge of the Greek and Latin classics, I think it would be an immense advantage; an advantage I do not possess, for my classical knowledge is scrappy, and in place of it I have a knowledge of Red Indian dogma: a dogma by the way that seems to me much nearer the African in type than Asiatic forms of dogma.</p>
<p>Armed with these instruments of observation, with a little industry and care you should in the mill of your mind be able to make the varied tangled rag-bag of facts that you will soon become possessed of into a paper.  And then I advise you to lay the results of your collection before some great thinker and he will write upon it the opinion that his greater and clearer vision makes him more fit to form.</p>
<p>You may say, Why not bring home these things in their raw state?  And bring them home in a raw state you must, for purposes of reference; but in this state they are of little use to a person unacquainted with the conditions which surround them in their native homes.  Also very few African stories bear on one subject alone, and they hardly ever stick to a point.  Take this Fernando Po legend.  Winwood Reade (<i>Savage Africa</i>, p. 62) gives it, and he says he heard it twice.  I have heard it, in variants, four times - once on Fernando Po, once in Calabar and twice in Gaboon.  So it is evidently an old story: -</p>
<p>“The first man called all people to one place.  His name was Raychow.  ‘Hear this, my people’ said he, ‘I am going to give a name to every place, I am King in this River.’  One day he came with his people to the Hole of Wonga Wonga, which is a deep pit in the ground from which fire comes at night.  Men spoke to them from the Hole, but they could not see them.  Raychow said to his son, ‘Go down into the Hole’ - and his son went.  The son of the King of the Hole came to him and defied him to a contest of throwing the spear.  If he lost he should be killed, if he won he should go back in safety.  He won - then the son of the King of the Hole said, ‘It is strange you should have won, for I am a spirit.  Ask whatever you wish,’ and the King’s son asked for a remedy for every disease he could remember; and the spirit gave him the medicines, and when he had done so, he said, ‘There is one sickness you have forgotten - it is the Krawkraw, and of that you shall die.’</p>
<p>“A tribe named Ndiva was then strong but now none remain (Winwood Reade says four remain).  They gave Raychow’s son a canoe and forty men, to take him back to his father’s town, and when he saw his father he did not speak.  His father said, ‘My son, if you are hungry eat.’  He did not answer, and his father said, ‘Do you wish me to kill a goat?’  He did not answer; his father said, ‘Do you wish me to give you new wives?’  He did not answer.  Then his father said, ‘Do you want me to build you a fetish hut?’  Then he answered, ‘Yes,’ and the hut was built, and the medicines he had brought back from the Hole were put into it.</p>
<p>“‘Now,’ said the son of King Raychow, ‘I go to make Moondah enter the Orongo’ (Gaboon); so he went and dug a canal and when this was finished all his men were dead.  Then he said, ‘I will go and kill river-horse in the Benito.’  He killed four, and as he was killing the fifth, the people descended from the mountains against him.  So he made fetish on his great war-spear and sang</p>
<p>     My spear, go kill these people,<br/>
     Or these people will kill me;</p>
<p>and the spear went and killed the people, except a few who got into canoes and flew to Fernando Po.  Then said their King, ‘My people shall never wear cloth till we have conquered the M’pongwe,’ and to this day the Fernando Poians go naked and hate with a special hatred the M’pongwe.”</p>
<p>Now this is a noble story - there is a lot of fine confused feeding in it, as the Scotchman said of boiled sheep’s head.</p>
<p>You learn from it -</p>
<p>A.  The name of the first man, and also that he was filled with a desire for topographical nomenclature.</p>
<p>B.  You hear of the Hole Wonga Wonga, and this is most interesting because to this day, apart from the story, you are told by the natives of a hole that emits fire, and Dr. Nassau says it is always said to be north of Gaboon; but so far no white man has any knowledge of an active volcano there, although the district is of volcanic origin.  The crater of Fernando Po may be referred to in the legend because of the king’s son being sent home in a canoe; but I do not think it is, because the Hole is known not to be Fernando Po, and it has got, according to local tradition, a river running from it or close to it.</p>
<p>C.  The kraw-kraw is a frightfully prevalent disease; no one has a remedy for it, presumably owing to Raychow’s son’s forgetfulness.</p>
<p>D.  The silence of the son to the questions is remarkable, because you always find people who have been among spirits lose their power of asking for what they want, for a time, and can only answer to the right question.</p>
<p>E.  The sudden way in which Raychow’s son gets fired with the desire to turn civil engineer just when he has got a magnificent opening in life as a doctor is merely the usual flightiness of young men, who do not see where their true advantages lie - and the conduct of the men in dying, after digging a canal is normal, and modern experiences support it, for men who dig canals down in West Africa die plentifully, be they black, white, or yellow; so you can’t help believing in those men, although it is strange a black man should have been so enterprising as to go in for canal digging at all.  There is no other case of it extant to my knowledge, and a remarkable fact is, that the Moondah does so nearly connect, by one creek, with the Gaboon estuary that you can drag a boat across the little intervening bit of land.</p>
<p>F.  Is a sporting story that turns up a little unexpectedly, certainly; but the Benito is within easy distance north of the Moondah, so the geography is all right.</p>
<p>G.  The inhabitants of Fernando Po have still an especial hatred for the M’pongwe, and both they and the M’pongwe have this account of the one tribe driving the other off the mainland.  Then the Bubis <a id="citation295"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote295" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{295}</a> - as the inhabitants on Fernando Po are called, from a confusion arising in the minds of the sailors calling at Fernando Po, between their stupidity and their word Bâbi = stranger, which they use as a word of greeting - these Bubis are undoubtedly a very early African race.  Their culture, though presenting some remarkable points, is on the whole exceedingly low.  They never wear clothes unless compelled to, and their language depends so much on gesture that they cannot talk in it to each other in the dark.</p>
<p>I give this as a sample of African stories.  It is far more connected and keeps to the point in a far more business-like way than most of them.  They are of great interest when you know the locality and the tribe they come from; but I am sure if you were to bring home a heap of stories like this, and empty them over any distinguished ethnologist’s head, without ticketing them with the culture of the tribe they belonged to, the conditions it lives under, and so forth, you would stun him with the seeming inter-contradiction of some, and utter pointlessness of the rest, and he would give up ethnology and hurriedly devote his remaining years to the attempt to collect a million postage stamps, so as to do something definite before he died.  Remember, you must always have your original material - carefully noted down at the time of occurrence - with you, so that you may say in answer to his Why? Because of this, and this, and this.</p>
<p>However good may be the outfit for your work that you take with you, you will have, at first, great difficulty in realising that it is possible for the people you are among really to believe things in the way they do.  And you cannot associate with them long before you must recognise that these Africans have often a remarkable mental acuteness and a large share of common sense; that there is nothing really “child-like” in their form of mind at all.  Observe them further and you will find they are not a flighty-minded, mystical set of people in the least.  They are not dreamers, or poets, and you will observe, and I hope observe closely - for to my mind this is the most important difference between their make of mind and our own - that they are notably deficient in all mechanical arts: they have never made, unless under white direction and instruction, a single fourteenth-rate piece of cloth, pottery, a tool or machine, house, road, bridge, picture or statue; that a written language of their own construction they none of them possess.  A careful study of the things a man, black or white, fails to do, whether for good or evil, usually gives you a truer knowledge of the man than the things he succeeds in doing.  When you fully realise this acuteness on one hand and this mechanical incapacity on the other which exist in the people you are studying, you can go ahead.  Only, I beseech you, go ahead carefully.  When you have found the easy key that opens the reason underlying a series of facts, as for example, these: a Benga spits on your hand as a greeting; you see a man who has been marching regardless through the broiling sun all the forenoon, with a heavy load, on entering a village and having put down his load, elaborately steal round in the shelter of the houses, instead of crossing the street; you come across a tribe that cuts its dead up into small pieces and scatters them broadcast, and another tribe that thinks a white man’s eye-ball is a most desirable thing to be possessed of - do not, when you have found this key, drop your collecting work, and go home with a shriek of “I know all about Fetish,” because you don’t, for the key to the above facts will not open the reason why it is regarded advisable to kill a person who is making Ikung; or why you should avoid at night a cotton tree that has red earth at its roots; or why combings of hair and paring of nails should be taken care of; or why a speck of blood that may fall from your flesh should be cut out of wood - if it has fallen on that - and destroyed, and if it has fallen on the ground stamped and rubbed into the soil with great care.  This set requires another key entirely.</p>
<p>I must warn you also that your own mind requires protection when you send it stalking the savage idea through the tangled forests, the dark caves, the swamps and the fogs of the Ethiopian intellect.  The best protection lies in recognising the untrustworthiness of human evidence regarding the unseen, and also the seen, when it is viewed by a person who has in his mind an explanation of the phenomenon before it occurs.  The truth is, the study of natural phenomena knocks the bottom out of any man’s conceit if it is done honestly and not by selecting only those facts that fit in with his preconceived or ingrafted notions.  And, to my mind, the wisest way is to get into the state of mind of an old marine engineer who oils and sees that every screw and bolt of his engines is clean and well watched, and who loves them as living things, caressing and scolding them himself, defending them, with stormy language, against the aspersions of the silly, uninformed outside world, which persists in regarding them as mere machines, a thing his superior intelligence and experience knows they are not.  Even animistic-minded I got awfully sat upon the other day in Cameroon by a superior but kindred spirit, in the form of a First Engineer.  I had thoughtlessly repeated some scandalous gossip against the character of a naphtha launch in the river.  “Stuff!” said he furiously; “she’s all right, and she’d go from June to January if those blithering fools would let her alone.”  Of course I apologised.</p>
<p>The religious ideas of the Negroes, <i>i.e</i>. the West Africans in the district from the Gambia to the Cameroon region, say roughly to the Rio del Rey (for the Bakwiri appear to have more of the Bantu form of idea than the negro, although physically they seem nearer the latter), differ very considerably from the religious ideas of the Bantu South-West Coast tribes.  The Bantu is vague on religious subjects; he gives one accustomed to the Negro the impression that he once had the same set of ideas, but has forgotten half of them, and those that he possesses have not got that hold on him that the corresponding or super-imposed Christian ideas have over the true Negro; although he is quite as keen on the subject of witchcraft, and his witchcraft differs far less from the witchcraft of the Negro than his religious ideas do.</p>
<p>The god, in the sense we use the word, is in essence the same in all of the Bantu tribes I have met with on the Coast: a non-interfering and therefore a negligible quantity.  He varies his name: Anzambi, Anyambi, Nyambi, Nzambi, Anzam, Nyam, Ukuku, Suku, and Nzam, but a better investigation shows that Nzam of the Fans is practically identical with Suku south of the Congo in the Bihe country, and so on.</p>
<p>They regard their god as the creator of man, plants, animals, and the earth, and they hold that having made them, he takes no further interest in the affair.  But not so the crowd of spirits with which the universe is peopled, they take only too much interest and the Bantu wishes they would not and is perpetually saying so in his prayers, a large percentage whereof amounts to “Go away, we don’t want you.”  “Come not into this house, this village, or its plantations.”  He knows from experience that the spirits pay little heed to these objurgations, and as they are the people who must be attended to, he develops a cult whereby they may be managed, used, and understood.  This cult is what we call witchcraft.</p>
<p>As I am not here writing a complete work on Fetish I will leave Nzam on one side, and turn to the inferior spirits.  These are almost all malevolent; sometimes they can be coaxed into having creditable feelings, like generosity and gratitude, but you can never trust them.  No, not even if you are yourself a well-established medicine man.  Indeed they are particularly dangerous to medicine men, just as lions are to lion tamers, and many a professional gentleman in the full bloom of his practice, gets eaten up by his own particular familiar which he has to keep in his own inside whenever he has not sent it off into other people’s.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the Reverend Doctor Nassau for a great quantity of valuable information regarding Bantu religious ideas - information which no one is so competent to give as he, for no one else knows the West Coast Bantu tribes with the same thoroughness and sympathy.  He has lived among them since 1851, and is perfectly conversant with their languages and culture, and he brings to bear upon the study of them a singularly clear, powerful, and highly-educated intelligence.</p>
<p>I shall therefore carefully ticket the information I have derived from him, so that it may not be mixed with my own.  I may be wrong in my deductions, but Dr. Nassau’s are above suspicion.</p>
<p>He says the origin of these spirits is vague - some of them come into existence by the authority of Anzam (by which you will understand, please, the same god I have quoted above as having many names), others are self-existent - many are distinctly the souls of departed human beings, “which in the future which is all around them” retain their human wants and feelings, and the Doctor assures me he has heard dying people with their last breath threatening to return as spirits to revenge themselves upon their living enemies.  He could not tell me if there was any duration set upon the existence as spirits of these human souls, but two Congo Français natives, of different tribes, Benga and Igalwa, told me that when a family had quite died out, after a time its spirits died too.  Some, but by no means all, of these spirits of human origin, as is the case among the Negro Effiks, undergo reincarnation.  The Doctor told me he once knew a man whose plantations were devastated by an elephant.  He advised that the beast should be shot, but the man said he dare not because the spirit of his dead father had passed into the elephant.</p>
<p>Their number is infinite and their powers as varied as human imagination can make them; classifying them is therefore a difficult work, but Doctor Nassau thinks this may be done fairly completely into: -</p>
<p>1.  Human disembodied spirits - <i>Manu</i>.</p>
<p>2.  Vague beings, well described by our word ghosts: <i>Abambo</i>.</p>
<p>3.  Beings something like dryads, who resent intrusion into their territory, on to their rock, past their promontory, or tree.  When passing the residence of one of these beings, the traveller must go by silently, or with some cabalistic invocation, with bowed or bared head, and deposit some symbol of an offering or tribute even if it be only a pebble.  You occasionally come across great trees that have fallen across a path that have quite little heaps of pebbles, small shells, etc., upon them deposited by previous passers-by.  This class is called <i>Ombwiri</i>.</p>
<p>4.  Beings who are the agents in causing sickness, and either aid or hinder human plans - <i>Mionde</i>.</p>
<p>5.  There seems to be, the Doctor says, another class of spirits somewhat akin to the ancient Lares and Penates, who especially belong to the household, and descend by inheritance with the family.  In their honour are secretly kept a bundle of finger, or other bones, nail-clippings, eyes, brains, skulls, particularly the lower jaws, called in M’pongwe <i>oginga</i>, accumulated from deceased members of successive generations.</p>
<p>Dr. Nassau says “secretly,” and he refers to this custom being existent in non-cannibal tribes.  I saw bundles of this character among the cannibal Fans, and among the non-cannibal Adooma, openly hanging up in the thatch of the sleeping apartment.</p>
<p>6.  He also says there may be a sixth class, which may, however only be a function of any of the other classes - namely, those that enter into any animal body, generally a leopard.  Sometimes the spirits of living human beings do this, and the animal is then guided by human intelligence, and will exercise its strength for the purposes of its temporary human possessor.  In other cases it is a non-human soul that enters into the animal, as in the case of Ukuku.</p>
<p>Spirits are not easily classified by their functions because those of different class may be employed in identical undertakings.  Thus one witch doctor may have, I find, particular influence over one class of spirit and another over another class; yet they will both engage to do identical work.  But in spite of this I do not see how you can classify spirits otherwise than by their functions; you cannot weigh and measure them, and it is only a few that show themselves in corporeal form.</p>
<p>There are characteristics that all the authorities seem agreed on, and one is that individual spirits in the same class vary in power: some are strong of their sort, some weak.</p>
<p>They are all to a certain extent limited in the nature of their power; there is no one spirit that can do all things; their efficiency only runs in certain lines of action and all of them are capable of being influenced, and made subservient to human wishes, by proper incantations.  This latter characteristic is of course to human advantage, but it has its disadvantages, for you can never really trust a spirit, even if you have paid a considerable sum to a most distinguished medicine man to get a powerful one put up in a ju-ju, or monde, <a id="citation301"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@5891@5891-h@5891-h-16.htm.html#footnote301" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">{301}</a> as it is called in several tribes.</p>
<p>The method of making these charms is much the same among Bantu and Negroes: I have elsewhere described the Gold Coast method, so here confine myself to the Bantu.  This similarity of procedure naturally arises from the same underlying idea existing in the two races.</p>
<p>You call in the medicine man, the “oganga,” as he is commonly called in Congo Français tribes.  After a variety of ceremonies and processes, the spirit is induced to localise itself in some object subject to the will of the possessor.  The things most frequently used are antelopes’ horns, the large snail-shells, and large nutshells, according to Doctor Nassau.  Among the Fan I found the most frequent charm-case was in the shape of a little sausage, made very neatly of pineapple fibre, the contents being the residence of the spirit or power, and the outside coloured red to flatter and please him - for spirits always like red because it is like blood.</p>
<p>The substance put inside charms is all manner of nastiness, usually on the sea coast having a high percentage of fowl dung.</p>
<p>The nature of the substance depends on the spirit it is intended to be attractive to - attractive enough to induce it to leave its present abode and come and reside in the charm.</p>
<p>In addition to this attractive substance I find there are other materials inserted which have relation towards the work the spirit will be wanted to do for its owner.  For example, charms made either to influence a person to be well disposed towards the owner, or the still larger class made with intent to work evil on other human beings against whom the owner has a grudge, must have in them some portion of the person to be dealt with - his hair, blood, nail-parings, etc. - or, failing that, his or her most intimate belonging, something that has got his smell in - a piece of his old waist-cloth for example.</p>
<p>This ability to obtain power over people by means of their blood, hair, nails, etc., is universally diffused; you will find it down in Devon, and away in far Cathay, and the Chinese, I am told, have in some parts of their empire little ovens to burn their nail- and hair-clippings in.  The fear of these latter belongings falling into the hands of evilly-disposed persons is ever present to the West Africans.  The Igalwa and other tribes will allow no one but a trusted friend to do their hair, and bits of nails and hair are carefully burnt or thrown away into a river; and blood, even that from a small cut or a fit of nose-bleeding, is most carefully covered up and stamped out if it has fallen on the earth.  The underlying idea regarding blood is of course the old one that the blood is the life.</p>
<p>The life in Africa means a spirit, hence the liberated blood is the liberated spirit, and liberated spirits are always whipping into people who do not want them.</p>
<p>Charms are made for every occupation and desire in life - loving, hating, buying, selling, fishing, planting, travelling, hunting, etc., and although they are usually in the form of things filled with a mixture in which the spirit nestles, yet there are other kinds; for example, a great love charm is made of the water the lover has washed in, and this, mingled with the drink of the loved one, is held to soften the hardest heart.</p>
<p>Some kinds of charms, such as those to prevent your getting drowned, shot, seen by elephants, etc., are worn on a bracelet or necklace.  A new-born child starts with a health-knot tied round the wrist, neck, or loins, and throughout the rest of its life its collection of charms goes on increasing.  This collection does not, however, attain inconvenient dimensions, owing to the failure of some of the charms to work.</p>
<p>That is the worst of charms and prayers.  The thing you wish of them may, and frequently does, happen in a strikingly direct way, but other times it does not.  In Africa this is held to arise from the bad character of the spirits; their gross ingratitude and fickleness.  You may have taken every care of a spirit for years, given it food and other offerings that you wanted for yourself, wrapped it up in your cloth on chilly nights and gone cold, put it in the only dry spot in the canoe, and so on, and yet after all this, the wretched thing will be capable of being got at by your rival or enemy and lured away, leaving you only the case it once lived in.</p>
<p>Finding, we will say, that you have been upset and half-drowned, and your canoe-load of goods lost three times in a week, that your paddles are always breaking, and the amount of snags in the river and so on is abnormal, you judge that your canoe-charm has stopped.  Then you go to the medicine man who supplied you with it and complain.  He says it was a perfectly good charm when he sold it you and he never had any complaints before, but he will investigate the affair; when he has done so, he either says the spirit has been lured away from the home he prepared for it by incantations and presents from other people, or that he finds the spirit is dead; it has been killed by a more powerful spirit of its class, which is in the pay of some enemy of yours.  In all cases the little thing you kept the spirit in is no use now, and only fit to sell to a white man as “a big curio!” and the sooner you let him have sufficient money to procure you a fresh and still more powerful spirit - necessarily more expensive - the safer it will be for you, particularly as your misfortunes distinctly point to some one being desirous of your death.  You of course grumble, but seeing the thing in his light you pay up, and the medicine man goes busily to work with incantations, dances, looking into mirrors or basins of still water, and concoctions of messes to make you a new protecting charm.</p>
<p>Human eye-balls, particularly of white men, I have already said are a great charm.  Dr. Nassau says he has known graves rifled for them.  This, I fancy, is to secure the “man that lives in your eyes” for the service of the village, and naturally the white man, being regarded as a superior being, would be of high value if enlisted into its service.  A similar idea of the possibility of gaining possession of the spirit of a dead man obtains among the Negroes, and the heads of important chiefs in the Calabar districts are usually cut off from the body on burial and kept secretly for fear the head, and thereby the spirit, of the dead chief, should be stolen from the town.  If it were stolen it would be not only a great advantage to its new possessor, but a great danger to the chief’s old town; because he would know all the peculiar ju-ju relating to it.  For each town has a peculiar one, kept exceedingly secret, in addition to the general ju-jus, and this secret one would then be in the hands of the new owners of the spirit.  It is for similar reasons that brave General MacCarthy’s head was treasured by the Ashantees, and so on.</p>
<p>Charms are not all worn upon the body, some go to the plantations, and are hung there, ensuring an unhappy and swift end for the thief who comes stealing.  Some are hung round the bows of the canoe, others over the doorway of the house, to prevent evil spirits from coming in - a sort of tame watch-dog spirits.</p>
